**Status:** In progress  
**Date:** 2026-03-10  
**Branch:** `codeql-workflow`  
**Scope:** Establish a practical SAST program for the `pg_trickle` PostgreSQL
extension that covers Rust application code, PostgreSQL extension attack

## Motivation

`pg_trickle` is not a typical Rust CLI or web service. It is a PostgreSQL
extension loaded directly into the database server process, which changes the
security profile materially:

- Memory safety bugs can affect the PostgreSQL backend itself.
- Unsafe FFI boundaries matter more because they run in-process with Postgres.
- Dynamic SQL built via SPI can become an injection or privilege-context risk.
- Security mistakes around `SECURITY DEFINER`, `search_path`, RLS, and GUCs are
  extension-specific and will not be caught by generic Rust tooling.
- Dependency and supply-chain issues matter because the extension ships as a
  privileged shared object.

The repo already has strong correctness testing and standard linting, but SAST
coverage is still partial. The goal of this plan is to add security-focused
static analysis without creating a noisy, low-signal CI burden.

---

## Threat Model and Security Surfaces

This plan assumes the main in-scope risks described in [SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md)
remain the priority:

1. SQL injection or object-name injection via `pgtrickle.*` functions.
2. Privilege escalation through `SECURITY DEFINER`, `SET ROLE`, `row_security`,
   or unpinned `search_path`.
3. Memory safety bugs in Rust code that crosses into PostgreSQL FFI.
4. Low-privilege denial-of-service via expensive refreshes, unbounded work, or
   unsafe background-worker behavior.
5. Information disclosure through change buffers, monitoring views, or
   unexpected visibility semantics.

### Primary code surfaces

| Surface | Why it matters | Representative files |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|
| Dynamic SPI SQL | Injection, quoting, object-name construction, role context | `src/api.rs`, `src/refresh.rs`, `src/cdc.rs`, `src/monitor.rs`, `src/hooks.rs` |
| Unsafe / FFI | In-process memory safety, pointer lifetime, Postgres ABI | `src/lib.rs`, `src/shmem.rs`, `src/api.rs`, `src/dvm/parser.rs` |
| Background workers | Long-lived privileged code, scheduling, retry loops | `src/scheduler.rs`, `src/wal_decoder.rs`, `src/shmem.rs` |
| Trigger / function SQL | `SECURITY DEFINER`, `search_path`, runtime SQL generation | `src/api.rs`, `src/ivm.rs`, `sql/*.sql` |
| Dependencies | RustSec CVEs, banned sources, duplicate major versions | `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock` |

### PostgreSQL-specific security surfaces

These are important enough that generic Rust SAST alone is insufficient:

- `Spi::run(&format!(...))` and `Spi::get_one(&format!(...))`
- `quote_identifier()` and other quoting helpers
- `NOTIFY` payload construction
- `ALTER TABLE`, `CREATE FUNCTION`, trigger generation, and `DEALLOCATE`
- `SET LOCAL row_security = off`
- `SECURITY DEFINER` and `SET search_path`
- background-worker bootstrap and shared-memory access

---

## Current State

### What already exists

| Control | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|------|
| `clippy` | Present | Fast lint gate in `lint.yml` and `build.yml` |
| `cargo audit` | Present | Weekly + PR dependency advisory workflow |
| Security reporting policy | Present | `SECURITY.md` documents private disclosure path |
| Extensive E2E correctness tests | Present | Good base, but not SAST |

### What is missing or incomplete

| Gap | Why it matters |
|-----|----------------|
| CodeQL for Rust | No higher-level code scanning for Rust dataflow and security patterns |
| Dependency policy enforcement | `cargo audit` does not cover banned sources or dependency hygiene well |
| Repo-specific SPI SQL rules | Generic scanners will miss extension-specific SQL construction risks |
| Unsafe-code inventory | No explicit unsafe budget or automated visibility into unsafe growth |
| Security-context rule checks | No automated review hooks for `SECURITY DEFINER`, `search_path`, RLS toggles |
| Finding policy | No documented path from advisory findings to blocking CI |

### Initial implementation on this branch

The following baseline has already been added on `codeql-workflow`:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` | CodeQL analysis for Rust |
| `.github/workflows/dependency-policy.yml` | `cargo deny` checks |
| `deny.toml` | Dependency-policy configuration |
| `.github/workflows/semgrep.yml` | Semgrep SARIF upload workflow |
| `.semgrep/pg_trickle.yml` | Initial repo-specific Semgrep rules |

This plan covers both that baseline and the next iterations needed to make it a
useful long-term SAST program.

---

## Goals and Non-Goals

### Goals

1. Catch obvious dependency and supply-chain issues automatically.
2. Make unsafe/FFI growth visible and reviewable.
3. Detect extension-specific SQL/security-context hazards early in PRs.
4. Keep the initial rollout low-noise enough that engineers will not disable it.
5. Evolve from advisory findings to blocking policies only after triage and rule tuning.

### Non-Goals

1. Replace runtime security testing or E2E role-based tests.
2. Prove absence of memory safety issues.
3. Fully model PostgreSQL execution semantics statically.
4. Block all dynamic SPI SQL. Dynamic SQL is legitimate in an extension; the
   objective is reviewability and safe construction, not blanket prohibition.

---

## Proposed SAST Stack

### Layer 1: CodeQL (Rust)

**Tool:** GitHub CodeQL  
**Purpose:** General Rust static analysis with control/dataflow analysis.  
**Why needed:** Catches classes of issues that clippy and grep-based tooling do
not, while integrating naturally with GitHub Security.

**Scope:**

- Rust source in `src/**`
- build configured via the repo's pgrx setup action
- SARIF findings uploaded to GitHub Security tab

**Expected value:**

- unsafe API misuse patterns
- suspicious string/data flow
- common Rust bug classes with security impact

### Layer 2: cargo-deny

**Tool:** `cargo deny`  
**Purpose:** Dependency policy enforcement beyond plain CVE scanning.  
**Why needed:** `cargo audit` is useful but narrow; `cargo deny` adds source,
duplicate-version, and registry hygiene checks.

**Checks to enforce initially:**

- advisories
- banned dependency patterns
- allowed registries / sources

**Checks to keep advisory initially:**

- multiple versions (`warn`)
- yanked crates (`warn`)

### Layer 3: Semgrep (extension-specific rules)

**Tool:** Semgrep  
**Purpose:** Repo-specific pattern checks that generic Rust scanners will not
model well.  
**Why needed:** The main security risk in this codebase is not generic “Rust
security”; it is the combination of SPI SQL, object-name quoting, PostgreSQL
privilege semantics, and generated SQL.

**Initial rule families:**

1. Dynamic SQL passed to `Spi::run`.
2. Dynamic SQL passed to `Spi::get_*` helpers.
3. `SECURITY DEFINER` occurrences in Rust-generated SQL or `sql/*.sql`.

**Initial operating mode:** advisory only (SARIF upload, no CI failure).

### Layer 4: Unsafe / FFI tracking

**Planned tools:**

- `cargo geiger` or equivalent unsafe inventory tooling
- stricter Rust/clippy lints around unsafe blocks where supported

**Purpose:**

- quantify unsafe usage growth
- make new unsafe entry points visible in PR review
- ensure every unsafe block remains documented and justified

### Layer 5: SQL / privilege-context review rules

This is the most important medium-term layer. The repo should gain static
checks that flag:

- `SECURITY DEFINER` without explicit `SET search_path`
- `SET LOCAL row_security = off`
- `SET ROLE` / `RESET ROLE`
- generated trigger functions
- dynamic `ALTER TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`, `TRUNCATE`, and `DEALLOCATE` SQL

These patterns are not automatically wrong, but they are security-sensitive and
deserve intentional review.

## Phase Plan

### Phase 0 — Baseline rollout (current branch)

**Status:** Implemented  
**Goal:** Introduce low-friction SAST foundations with minimal CI disruption.

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|------|
| CodeQL workflow | Done | Manual Rust build with pgrx toolchain |
| `cargo deny` workflow + config | Done | Advisory/supply-chain policy checks |
| Semgrep workflow + starter rules | Done | Advisory-only SARIF upload |

**Exit criteria:**

- workflows validate cleanly
- repo still passes `just lint`
- branch can be reviewed and merged independently

### Phase 1 — Triage and noise reduction

**Priority:** P0  
**Estimated effort:** 2–4 hours after first CI run.

**Tasks:**

1. Run the new workflows once on this branch.
2. Export or review initial findings from CodeQL and Semgrep.
3. Classify findings into:
   - true positives
   - acceptable dynamic SQL requiring documentation
   - noisy patterns that need rule refinement
4. Tune Semgrep rules to reduce obvious false positives.
5. Add inline suppression guidance where exceptions are legitimate.

**Deliverables:**

- first triage pass documented in PR comments or follow-up issue
- reduced-noise Semgrep ruleset

### Phase 2 — Extension-specific rule expansion

**Priority:** P0  
**Estimated effort:** 4–8 hours.

**Tasks:**

1. Add Semgrep rules for `SECURITY DEFINER` plus `search_path` pairing.
2. Add rules for `SET LOCAL row_security = off`.
3. Add rules for `SET ROLE` / `RESET ROLE`.
4. Add rules for `Spi::run(&format!(...))` where interpolated values are not
   wrapped in local quoting helpers.
5. Add rules for unsafe blocks without a nearby `SAFETY:` comment.

**Deliverables:**

- broader Semgrep ruleset
- documented suppression policy for legitimate dynamic SQL

### Phase 3 — Unsafe growth controls

**Priority:** P1  
**Estimated effort:** 2–4 hours.

**Tasks:**

1. Add `cargo geiger` or an equivalent unsafe inventory step.
2. Record the baseline unsafe count.
3. Fail CI if unsafe count increases unexpectedly, or at minimum surface it in
   the PR as a diff signal.
4. Review whether `undocumented_unsafe_blocks` can be enforced through clippy
   or another linter in this toolchain.

**Deliverables:**

- unsafe inventory workflow/report
- explicit policy on unsafe growth

### Phase 4 — Move from advisory to blocking

**Priority:** P1  
**Estimated effort:** 2–3 hours after rules stabilize.

**Tasks:**

1. Keep CodeQL and cargo-deny blocking.
2. Change only high-confidence Semgrep rules to blocking.
3. Leave broader “review-required” rules as informational if they remain noisy.
4. Document which classes are blockers and why.

**Deliverables:**

- clear blocking policy in CI
- reduced chance of engineers papering over the toolchain

### Phase 5 — Link static findings to runtime security tests

**Priority:** P2  
**Estimated effort:** 4–8 hours.

**Tasks:**

1. Add E2E tests for security-sensitive paths highlighted by SAST:
   - RLS behavior
   - SECURITY DEFINER trigger behavior
   - low-privilege access to monitoring views / change buffers
   - SQL injection attempts through API inputs
2. Map static rules to runtime coverage so a suppressed SAST finding still has a
   compensating test where appropriate.

**Deliverables:**

- security-focused E2E coverage plan or implementation

## Semgrep Rules Roadmap

### Current rules

| Rule ID | Purpose | Mode |
|--------|---------|------|
| `rust.spi.run.dynamic-format` | Flag dynamic SQL passed to `Spi::run` | Advisory |
| `rust.spi.query.dynamic-format` | Flag dynamic SQL passed to `Spi::get_*` | Advisory |
| `sql.security-definer.present` | Surface `SECURITY DEFINER` for review | Advisory |

### Planned next rules

| Category | Candidate rule | Value |
|----------|----------------|------|
| SQL quoting | Detect string interpolation into SPI SQL without quoting helper | High |
| Privilege context | `SECURITY DEFINER` without `SET search_path` | High |
| Role changes | `SET ROLE`, `RESET ROLE`, `row_security = off` | High |
| Unsafe docs | `unsafe` without nearby `SAFETY:` comment | Medium |
| Panics in SQL path | `unwrap()` / `expect()` / `panic!()` in non-test SQL-reachable code | Medium |
| GUC-sensitive SQL | direct `SET LOCAL work_mem`, `SET LOCAL row_security` review hooks | Medium |

### False-positive strategy

Do not attempt to make the first Semgrep rules perfectly precise. Instead:

1. Start broad.
2. Triage actual hits.
3. Narrow only where noise is unacceptable.
4. Keep “review-required” rules informational instead of blocking.

This is especially important because a PostgreSQL extension often needs dynamic
object names; the real question is whether they are safely quoted, not whether
dynamic SQL exists at all.

---

## Unsafe / FFI Review Strategy

Unsafe code in this repo is legitimate but high-impact. The policy should be:

1. Every unsafe block has a `SAFETY:` comment.
2. Unsafe growth is visible in PRs.
3. New unsafe blocks are reviewed as security-relevant changes, not merely
   implementation details.

### Review checklist for unsafe additions

- What Postgres invariant does this rely on?
- Is the pointer lifetime guaranteed by the surrounding callback/API?
- Can the same logic be expressed with a safe wrapper from `pgrx`?
- Does this code run in a background worker or user-triggered SQL path?
- What happens if Postgres returns null, stale, or unexpected node types?

### Candidate automation

- `cargo geiger` report in CI
- Semgrep rule for `unsafe {` without nearby `SAFETY:`
- code-review requirement for files containing new unsafe blocks

---

## CI Integration Strategy

The SAST system should respect the repo's existing fast/slow pyramid.

### Recommended posture

| Workflow | Trigger | Blocking? | Rationale |
|----------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| CodeQL | PR, push to main, weekly | Yes | High-value, low-maintenance |
| cargo-deny | PR, dependency changes, weekly | Yes | Good supply-chain hygiene |
| cargo-audit | Keep existing | Yes | Advisory DB coverage already in place |
| Semgrep | PR, push, weekly | No initially | Needs tuning first |

### Why Semgrep starts advisory

The repo has many legitimate dynamic SPI SQL callsites. If Semgrep is blocking
immediately, engineers will either disable it or add broad suppressions. An
advisory phase preserves signal while the rules are tuned.

---

## Finding Triage and Policy

### Severity mapping

| Finding type | Target policy |
|-------------|---------------|
| Known vulnerable dependency | Block merge |
| Unknown crate source / banned source | Block merge |
| High-confidence CodeQL issue | Block merge unless justified |
| `SECURITY DEFINER` without safe context | Block once rule is tuned |
| Generic dynamic SPI SQL | Advisory unless unsafe interpolation is proven |
| Unsafe block increase | Advisory first, then block if policy is accepted |

### Triage rules

1. Suppressions must be narrow and justified.
2. A suppression should explain why the pattern is safe in PostgreSQL terms,
   not only why the tool is noisy.
3. When a noisy pattern repeats, refine the rule rather than scattering ignores.

---

## Validation Plan

### Static validation

After changes to the SAST config itself:

```bash
just fmt
just lint
```

### Workflow validation

Manual dispatch after merge or on the PR branch:

1. Run `CodeQL` and confirm SARIF upload succeeds.
2. Run `Dependency policy` and confirm `cargo deny` resolves the graph cleanly.
3. Run `Semgrep` and capture the first findings set.

### Triage validation

For each Semgrep rule added:

1. Confirm it catches at least one real representative pattern.
2. Confirm it does not flood obviously safe code paths with unusable noise.
3. Confirm the remediation message is specific enough for reviewers.

---

## Success Criteria

This plan is successful when all of the following are true:

1. Dependency advisories and bad sources are enforced automatically.
2. CodeQL findings appear in GitHub Security for Rust changes.
3. Security-sensitive SPI SQL and privilege-context patterns are surfaced in PRs.
4. Unsafe growth is visible and reviewable.
5. Engineers trust the signal enough to keep the checks enabled.

### Phase completion criteria

| Phase | Done when |
|------|-----------|
| Phase 0 | Workflows merged and repo lint remains clean |
| Phase 1 | First findings triaged and Semgrep noise reduced |
| Phase 2 | High-value extension-specific rules added |
| Phase 3 | Unsafe inventory visible in CI |
| Phase 4 | High-confidence rules become blocking |
| Phase 5 | Static findings mapped to runtime security tests |

---

## Implementation Checklist

### Done on this branch

- [x] Add CodeQL workflow for Rust
- [x] Add `cargo deny` policy workflow
- [x] Add `deny.toml`
- [x] Add initial Semgrep workflow
- [x] Add starter Semgrep ruleset
- [x] Validate the repo still passes `just lint`

### Next implementation tasks

- [ ] Run all new workflows once and capture findings
- [ ] Triage first Semgrep and CodeQL results
- [ ] Add `SECURITY DEFINER` + `search_path` pairing rule
- [ ] Add `row_security` / `SET ROLE` rules
- [ ] Add unsafe inventory reporting
- [ ] Decide which Semgrep rules should become blocking
- [ ] Add documentation for suppression / false-positive handling

---

## Open Questions

1. Should Semgrep eventually fail PRs, or remain advisory with only select
   high-confidence rules blocking?
2. Do we want unsafe growth to hard-fail CI, or just surface as a review signal?
3. Should `cargo audit` remain separate from `cargo deny`, or be consolidated
   once confidence in `cargo deny` is established?
4. Do we want a dedicated security-review checklist for PRs that touch:
   - `Spi::run(&format!(...))`
   - `unsafe`
   - `SECURITY DEFINER`
   - `row_security`
   - background-worker logic?
5. Should a later phase add CodeQL custom queries for pgrx/PostgreSQL-specific
   APIs, or is Semgrep sufficient for that layer?

---

## Recommendation

Merge Phase 0 now. Then treat the first real workflow run as a tuning exercise,
not a pass/fail judgment on the codebase. The highest-value next move is to
reduce Semgrep noise while expanding checks around `SECURITY DEFINER`,
`search_path`, and `row_security`, because those are the extension-specific
security hazards most likely to evade generic Rust tooling.

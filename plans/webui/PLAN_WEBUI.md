## Executive Summary

The pg-trickle WebUI is a browser-based management console and operational
dashboard embedded in the `pgtrickle-relay` binary. It provides a complete
view of the streaming materialization pipeline — from external sources
through relay ingestion, stream table chains, outboxes, and relay sinks —
in a single unified interface.

The WebUI replaces the need for direct SQL interaction for common operations
while keeping SQL as the canonical configuration layer. Every write action
in the WebUI generates SQL, shows a preview, and executes it against
PostgreSQL on confirmation. Power users can copy the generated SQL into
version-controlled migrations.

The JSON API layer (`/api/v1/`) that backs the WebUI is simultaneously
an **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** — the same endpoints that the
frontend calls are discoverable and callable by LLM agents (Copilot,
Claude, custom agents). This means the API is a first-class integration
surface, not just WebUI plumbing, and is designed with semver stability
guarantees from Phase 0.

The scope is deliberately broader than a monitoring dashboard: at full
maturity, the WebUI enables setting up a complete streaming solution —
CDC sources, stream tables, relay pipelines — entirely through the
browser or via LLM agents calling the API. This positions pg-trickle as
an accessible alternative to managed streaming platforms (RisingWave
Cloud, Confluent Cloud, Materialize) while retaining PostgreSQL as the
foundation.

---

## Motivation

The current getting-started path requires:

1. Install the PostgreSQL extension
2. Write SQL to create stream tables and configure CDC
3. Install the relay binary and configure it via SQL
4. Use the TUI or raw SQL to monitor

Each step requires a different tool and a different skill set. The WebUI
collapses steps 2–4 into a single browser interface. The three audiences
this unlocks:

- **"I just want it working in 10 minutes"** — the wizard path, no SQL
  knowledge required.
- **"I want to understand what's happening"** — the SQL preview at every
  step teaches the pg-trickle SQL API by example.
- **"I need full control"** — the SQL escape hatch and CLI still work. The
  WebUI is additive.

## Target Users

### 1. Data Engineer

**Primary use:** Author stream tables and relay pipelines without writing
SQL from scratch. The DVM compatibility checker gives instant feedback on
whether a view definition supports DIFFERENTIAL refresh before committing.

**Key features:** Stream table wizard, DVM checker, relay pipeline editor,
topology graph, column-level lineage.

### 2. SRE / Operator (on-call)

**Primary use:** Assess health during incidents without SSH access. The
relay's HTTP port is already exposed — `/ui` is just another route.

**Key features:** Health scorecard, SLA budget dashboard, live alert feed,
fuse management, relay topology with lag indicators, refresh timeline.

### 3. Data Analyst

**Primary use:** Explore derived data and understand lineage — where does
this metric come from? What tables does it depend on?

**Key features:** Column-level lineage, data explorer (sample rows),
schema browser, staleness badges.

### 4. Platform Engineer

**Primary use:** Manage relay pipelines at scale, monitor CDC health,
verify worker pool utilization.

**Key features:** Relay pipeline management, watermark/frontier view,
worker pool status, fuse control, change buffer inspection.

### 5. LLM Agent / Automation

**Primary use:** Programmatically create stream tables, configure relay
pipelines, and diagnose issues via the `/api/v1/` JSON API. The same
API that backs the WebUI frontend is the natural integration surface
for LLM agents (Copilot, Claude, custom agents) and automation scripts.

**Key features:** `POST /api/v1/sql/preview` (DVM compatibility check
before applying), `POST /api/v1/sql/execute` (apply changes),
`GET /api/v1/dag/topology` (understand full pipeline),
`GET /api/v1/health` (diagnose problems), MCP server endpoints.

**Key insight:** LLM agents will handle most initial setup tasks
(creating stream tables, configuring relay pipelines) via natural
language → SQL generation. This reduces the urgency of Tier 3 wizard
features while increasing the importance of the API layer as a
first-class integration surface. See
[LLM Agent Integration & MCP Server](#llm-agent-integration--mcp-server).

## Architecture

### Hosting Model

The WebUI is embedded in the `pgtrickle-relay` binary. This follows the
RisingWave model: the frontend is built to static files (Next.js `out/`
or equivalent), bundled into the Rust binary via `rust-embed`, and served
by the existing Axum HTTP server.

```
pgtrickle-relay serve
  ├── :9090/metrics          Prometheus scrape
  ├── :9090/health           Health check (K8s probes)
  ├── :9090/health/drained   Drain check (rolling deploys)
  ├── :9090/webhook/...      Reverse-mode webhook receiver
  ├── :9090/api/v1/...       JSON API (WebUI backend)
  ├── :9090/api/v1/ws        WebSocket (live alerts, topology updates)
  └── :9090/ui/...           Static frontend (rust-embed)
```

**Key property:** No Node.js in production. The frontend is pre-built at
compile time and embedded as static assets. The relay binary is the only
thing to deploy.

**Feature-flagged:** `--features webui` controls whether the static assets
and API routes are compiled in. The minimal relay sidecar image ships
without it; a "full" image includes the UI. Both images are published.

### Authentication

Three modes, selectable via `--auth none|pg|oidc`:

| Mode | How it works | Use case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **`none`** (default) | No login. WebUI uses the relay's PG connection. | Sidecar behind VPN/ingress |
| **`pg`** | Login form with PG username/password. Per-session connection pool. Respects PG roles and RLS. | Shared team deployment |
| **`oidc`** | OAuth2/OIDC login (Google, GitHub, Okta). Maps `sub` claim → PG role via config. | Enterprise / multi-tenant |

Auth is implemented as Axum middleware on the `/api/v1/` and `/ui/` routes.
The `/metrics` and `/health` endpoints remain unauthenticated (Prometheus
and K8s probes need direct access).

### Frontend Technology

**Recommended: Next.js (React), built to static HTML, embedded via
`rust-embed`.**

Rationale:

- The DAG/topology visualization, live backpressure animation, and
  time-series charts are client-heavy features. Server-side rendering
  (HTMX) cannot match the UX quality for these use cases.
- RisingWave uses the same stack (Next.js + static export) and has
  maintained it for 4+ years successfully.
- The JS ecosystem for graph rendering (Cytoscape.js, reactflow, D3),
  charting (ECharts, Recharts), and code editing (Monaco) is
  unmatched.
- Build process: `npm run build` → `out/` → `rust-embed` → single
  binary. CI builds the frontend as a pre-step before `cargo build`.

**Decision: Next.js from the start.** The topology graph, live
backpressure animations, and time-series charts are the centrepiece
features and require a proper JS framework. Starting with HTMX would
require a rewrite for Tier 2/3. CI will include a Node.js + `npm run
build` pre-step before `cargo build`.

**Alternatives rejected:** HTMX + Askama templates (insufficient for
graph rendering and real-time UX). Leptos (too small an ecosystem for
charting and graph visualization).

### Backend API Layer

A JSON REST API under `/api/v1/` that serves three consumers:

1. **WebUI frontend** — the primary consumer, calls these endpoints
   for all data and write operations.
2. **LLM agents** — use the same endpoints to understand, configure,
   and diagnose pg-trickle programmatically. The API is the MCP/tool
   integration surface (see [MCP Server](#mcp-server)).
3. **Scripts and third-party tools** — Grafana annotations, CI/CD
   pipelines, custom dashboards.

The API is treated as a **first-class public contract** with semver
guarantees from Phase 0. Breaking changes require a version bump
(`/api/v2/`). This stability commitment is critical because LLM agents
and automation scripts depend on predictable schemas.

POST /api/v1/sql/execute                Execute SQL (with auth check)
POST /api/v1/fuses/:name/reset          Reset a blown fuse
POST /api/v1/tables/:name/refresh       Trigger manual refresh
```

The CDC, fuse, scheduler, and slot endpoints remain in the API for
programmatic access and the Health page's drill-down views. They are
not top-level navigation items in the WebUI — they live under Health.

Every write endpoint (`POST`) requires authentication in `pg` and `oidc`
modes. In `none` mode, writes use the relay's PG connection.

### Real-Time Data

Two distinct live-update tiers, both delivered via the same WebSocket
channel (`/api/v1/ws`):

#### Tier A — State Live (badge/metric updates)

Node decorations update without changing graph structure: staleness
counters tick up, buffer depth badges change, relay lag updates, SLA
colour transitions (green → amber → red), alert feed entries appear.

Source: `pg_trickle_alert` NOTIFY channel + relay pipeline state
changes broadcast from `AppState.ws_broadcast`. Frontend receives
`WsEvent::StateUpdate` and patches node/edge data in-place — no
graph re-layout required.

#### Tier B — Structure Live (topology changes)

Graph nodes and edges appear or disappear: a new stream table is
created, a relay pipeline is added, a CDC trigger is enabled on a
source table. This requires a graph re-fetch and re-render.

Source: a new `pgtrickle_structure_changed` NOTIFY channel emitted
by the existing DDL event trigger hooks in the extension. The relay
listens on this channel alongside `pg_trickle_alert` and broadcasts
`WsEvent::TopologyChanged` to connected WebSocket clients.

Frontend behaviour on `WsEvent::TopologyChanged`:
1. Re-fetch `GET /api/v1/dag/topology`
2. Diff the new node/edge list against the current graph
3. Animate nodes appearing (fade-in) or disappearing (fade-out)
4. Preserve current zoom/pan position and node layout where possible

The topology payload is small (tens of nodes in typical deployments),
so a full re-fetch is simpler and sufficient — no differential graph
patching needed.

**Round-trip latency** from "Apply" click to node appearing on graph:
- PG DDL execution + trigger: ~5–20 ms
- NOTIFY delivery: ~1 ms
- Relay LISTEN → `WsEvent::TopologyChanged`: ~1 ms
- Browser re-fetch + re-render: ~50–100 ms
- **Total: ~100 ms** — tight enough to feel instantaneous

**Multi-user coordination:** All connected WebUI clients (multiple
browser tabs, multiple team members) receive the same
`WsEvent::TopologyChanged` event simultaneously. An SRE watching the
topology dashboard sees a new stream table appear the moment a data
engineer or LLM agent applies the `CREATE STREAM TABLE` SQL — without
refreshing the page.

**Optimistic updates (Tier 2+):** When the current user applies SQL
via the WebUI's SQL preview model, the frontend can show the new node
*immediately* (before PG confirms) and reconcile with the server
response. If execution fails, the optimistic node is removed and the
error is shown. This requires the frontend to predict the topology
change from the SQL statement — feasible for simple cases
(`CREATE STREAM TABLE`, relay pipeline insert) but not for complex DDL.
Implemented as a Tier 2 enhancement, not required for Tier 1.

**Polling fallback:** For environments where WebSocket is blocked
(some corporate proxies), the frontend falls back to polling
`/api/v1/health` and `/api/v1/dag/topology` at a configurable
interval (default 5s). Structure changes are detected by comparing
the node list on each poll.

## Feature Tiers

### Tier 1 — Read-Only Dashboard

**Goal:** Replace the TUI's monitoring capabilities in a browser. Zero
write operations. Ships with the first WebUI release.

| Feature | Source data | TUI equivalent |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| **Health scorecard** | `health_check()`, `health_summary()` | View 8 (Health Checks) |
| **Stream table list** | `pg_stat_stream_tables`, `pgt_status()` | View 1 (Dashboard) |
| **Stream table detail** | `st_refresh_stats()`, `get_staleness()` | View 2 (Detail) |
| **Unified topology graph** | `dependency_tree()` + relay pipeline config | View 3 (Dependencies) — enhanced |
| **Refresh timeline** | `refresh_timeline()` | View 4 (Refresh Log) — as chart |
| **CDC health** | `check_cdc_health()`, `slot_health()` | View 6 (CDC Health) |
| **Live alerts** | `pg_trickle_alert` via WebSocket | View 9 (Alerts) |
| **Relay pipeline status** | Relay metrics + pipeline config | *New — no TUI equivalent* |
| **SLA budget indicators** | `get_staleness()` + schedule interval | *New — no TUI equivalent* |
| **Worker pool status** | `worker_pool_status()` | View W (Workers) |
| **Fuse status** | `fuse_status()` | View F (Fuse) — read only |
| **Configuration view** | GUC values, extension version | View 7 (Configuration) |

### Tier 2 — Relay Pipeline Management

**Goal:** Create, edit, and manage relay pipelines through the UI. First
write operations. SQL preview before every action.

| Feature | Generated SQL |
|---------|--------------|
| **Create forward pipeline** | `INSERT INTO pgtrickle.relay_outbox_config(...)` |
| **Create reverse pipeline** | `INSERT INTO pgtrickle.relay_inbox_config(...)` |
| **Edit pipeline** | `UPDATE pgtrickle.relay_outbox_config SET ... WHERE ...` |
| **Enable/disable pipeline** | `UPDATE ... SET enabled = true/false` |
| **Delete pipeline** | `DELETE FROM pgtrickle.relay_outbox_config WHERE ...` |
| **Fuse reset** | `SELECT pgtrickle.reset_fuse(...)` |
| **Manual refresh** | `SELECT pgtrickle.refresh(...)` |
| **Pause/resume stream table** | `SELECT pgtrickle.alter_stream_table(...)` |

**Backend form:** When creating a pipeline, the form generates the
`INSERT INTO pgtrickle.relay_outbox_config` or `relay_inbox_config` SQL
with the JSONB config object. Credential fields are shown as
`${env:VAR_NAME}` or `${file:/path/to/secret}` reference tokens —
the relay resolves these from the process environment at startup.
Secrets never pass through the WebUI or get stored in the database.

### Tier 3 — Stream Table Wizard & Full Setup (Deprioritized)

**Goal:** Set up a complete streaming solution through the browser without
writing SQL manually.

> **Note:** Tier 3 is deprioritized relative to Tiers 1 and 2. LLM agents
> can already handle most setup tasks (creating stream tables, configuring
> CDC, writing relay pipeline config) via natural language → SQL generation.
> The DVM compatibility checker remains high-value as an API endpoint
> (`POST /api/v1/sql/preview`) that agents call directly. The wizard UI
> around it is a nice-to-have, not a prerequisite for the "10-minute setup"
> experience — an agent achieves that today. Tier 3 should be built when
> there is specific user demand for form-based setup that agents don't
> cover well.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **DVM compatibility checker** | Paste/type a view definition. Live analysis shows: DIFFERENTIAL eligible ✅ or FULL REFRESH ⚠️ with explanation of unsupported constructs. Uses `validation.rs` logic via the `/api/v1/sql/preview` endpoint. |
| **Stream table creation wizard** | Form: pick source view, schedule (slider 1s→1h), refresh mode, SLA threshold. Generates `CREATE STREAM TABLE` SQL with preview. |
| **CDC source enablement** | Pick a table → enable CDC trigger. Generates `pgtrickle.enable_cdc(...)`. |
| **Schema browser** | Stream tables grouped by schema. Column types, nullability, PK columns marked. Staleness badge on every table. |
| **Monaco SQL editor** | Embedded SQL editor with pg-trickle function autocomplete, syntax highlighting, and DVM compatibility checking as you type. |
| **Column-level lineage** | Click a stream table column → trace derivation back to source columns through the entire OpTree. Rendered as a focused sub-graph. |
| **DVM operator inspector** | For each stream table: visualize the operator tree (Scan → Filter → Join → Aggregate), annotated with which operators are incrementally maintained, which use auxiliary columns, and which force FULL refresh. Rendered via `graphviz-wasm` in the browser. |

## Key Features — Detailed Design

### Pipelines (End-to-End Flows)

The primary navigational concept in the WebUI. A **pipeline** (also
called a **flow**) is an end-to-end data path derived from the DAG:
every maximal path from a leaf source (base table or relay reverse
input) to a leaf sink (stream table with no dependents, or relay
forward output).

```
Kafka:orders → orders_raw → revenue_7d → regional_summary → NATS:analytics
```

That is one pipeline. pg-trickle doesn't store pipelines as a formal
object — they are computed at query time from the DAG. The
`GET /api/v1/flows` endpoint returns all maximal source-to-sink paths,
each with:

- A stable ID (hash of the node sequence)
- The ordered list of nodes in the path
- Aggregate SLA status (worst node determines the flow's status)
- End-to-end latency (cumulative staleness from source to sink)
- Throughput (minimum throughput across edges — the bottleneck)

**Why pipelines instead of tables or relay connectors as the list view:**
Users think in terms of data flows, not individual nodes. "Is my
orders-to-analytics flow healthy?" is a more natural question than
"Is `regional_summary` healthy?" The pipeline view answers the first
question directly. Individual node detail (stream table stats, relay
connector config) is accessed by clicking a node within a pipeline.

A stream table that appears in multiple flows (e.g., a shared dimension
table like `customers`) appears in multiple pipeline rows — correctly
reflecting its operational blast radius.

**Orphan tables** (stream tables with no downstream consumers and no
upstream relay source) appear as single-node pipelines. This makes
orphans visible rather than hidden.

The **Pipelines** page is the list/tabular view of the same information
that the **Topology** page shows spatially. Two views of the same data,
optimized for different tasks:

| Task | Best view |
|---|---|
| Understand system architecture | Topology (graph) |
| Find the flow breaching SLA | Pipelines (sorted by worst SLA) |
| Trace data from source to sink | Pipeline detail (ordered node list) |
| Filter by refresh mode or schema | Pipelines list with faceted filters |
| See end-to-end latency | Pipeline detail (cumulative lag) |

### Unified Topology Graph

The centrepiece of the WebUI. A multi-level interactive graph using
**semantic zoom** — the graph shows the logical structure at whatever
level of detail the user is looking at, from systems overview to
individual node.

**Three zoom levels:**

**Level 0 — Systems overview (landing).** One node per PostgreSQL
schema. External relay endpoints (Kafka, NATS, webhook, etc.) appear
as leaf circles attached to the schema that contains their inbox or
outbox table.

A schema can have **multiple relay inboxes from different backends** —
one Kafka consumer, one webhook receiver, one file watcher — all
writing into the same `erp_raw` schema. At Level 0 they each appear
as a separate leaf circle on the `erp_raw` node. The schema remains
the single named group: "Is ERP data healthy?" is answered by
`erp_raw`'s aggregate status badge, regardless of how many backends
feed it or what transport they use. The schema is the logical unit;
the relay endpoints are transport plumbing.

**Level 1 — Group detail.** Click a schema group or an edge between
two groups to see all individual nodes within that scope. Shows
partial pipelines between adjacent groups (e.g., all flows from
`erp_raw` to `canonical`). This is the level where individual stream
table nodes appear with their status badges.

**Level 2 — Individual flow.** Click a specific flow line to see the
full pipeline detail — every node from source to sink with staleness,
buffer depth, SLA budget.

For **small deployments** (all objects in `public`, no relay), Level 0
and Level 1 collapse into a single flat graph showing all nodes
directly.

**Node types and visual encoding:**

| Node type | Shape | Colour | Badge |
|-----------|-------|--------|-------|
| Schema group (Level 0) | Rounded rectangle, thick border | Worst-child SLA colour | Object count + status summary |
| External relay endpoint (Level 0 leaf) | Circle | Blue (connected) / Red (disconnected) | Backend type icon |
| External source (Kafka, NATS, ...) | Rounded rectangle | Grey | Backend icon |
| Relay pipeline | Hexagon | Blue (connected) / Red (disconnected) | Lag rows |
| Inbox / Outbox table | Rectangle, dashed border | Teal | Buffer depth |
| Source base table | Rectangle | White | CDC mode |
| Stream table | Rectangle, bold border | Green / Amber / Red (by SLA) | Staleness |

**Edge encoding:**

- Width proportional to throughput (rows/sec over last 5 min)
- At Level 0: width proportional to pipeline count, colour = worst SLA
- Colour: green (healthy), amber (lag growing), red (SLA breach)
- Animated dots for active data flow (like RisingWave's backpressure)

**Interactions:**

- Click a group node (Level 0) → drill into Level 1 (schema detail)
- Click an edge between groups → show partial pipelines between them
- Click a node (Level 1) → opens detail panel (stats, config, history)
- Hover an edge → shows throughput, lag, last update timestamp
- Breadcrumb trail at top: Systems > erp_raw > orders_raw
- Back button / breadcrumb returns to previous zoom level
- Time slider → replays historical state using `refresh_timeline()` data
- Zoom/pan, drag-to-rearrange
- Deep-linkable: `/ui/topology?focus=revenue_7d` highlights a node

**Live updates:**
- `WsEvent::StateUpdate` → badge values update in-place (no re-layout)
- `WsEvent::TopologyChanged` → re-fetch topology, animate new/removed
  nodes, preserve zoom/pan and existing node positions
- Optimistic node insertion when the current user applies SQL (Tier 2+)

**Implementation:** Cytoscape.js or reactflow for the graph layout. DAG
data from `/api/v1/dag/topology` (extends `dependency_tree()` with relay
pipeline nodes). WebSocket-driven updates; 5s polling fallback.

### SLA Budget & Lag Monitoring

Inspired by Kafka consumer lag dashboards. Three lag dimensions, each
visible inline on the stream table list and topology graph:

| Dimension | Metric source | Kafka analog |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Change buffer depth** | `change_buffer_sizes()` | Messages not yet consumed |
| **Staleness** | `get_staleness()` vs schedule interval | Consumer group time lag |
| **Relay pipeline lag** | `relay_consumer_lag_rows` | Sink-side consumer lag |

**SLA budget display:**

```
Table              Staleness    Buffer   SLA Budget   Trend
revenue_7d         12s / 60s    0 rows   ██░░░ 20%    ↔ stable
regional_summary   45s / 60s    1,204    ████████ 75% ↑ burning
orders_hourly      61s / 60s    8,102    ██████████   🔴 BREACH
```

**Burn rate:** Derived from staleness trend over a sliding window. If the
SLA is "max 30s stale" and the table is 25s stale and trending upward,
the burn rate shows the remaining time before breach.

**End-to-end lag:** The topology graph shows cumulative lag through the
dependency chain. A 2s delay in `orders` CDC that compounds to 45s
end-to-end staleness in `regional_summary` is visible at a glance. No
generic monitoring tool understands this relationship.

**SLA configuration:** Inferred from the schedule interval with no
schema changes required:

- Staleness > 2× schedule interval = **warning** (amber)
- Staleness > 3× schedule interval = **breach** (red)

For example, a table with a 60s schedule triggers a warning at 120s
staleness and a breach at 180s. This provides useful SLA monitoring
out of the box without any user configuration. Explicit per-table SLA
thresholds (via a SQL function) can be added later if needed.

### DVM Operator Inspector

For each stream table, the WebUI renders the DVM operator tree showing
exactly how pg-trickle processes incremental changes:

```
Aggregate (GROUP BY region)
  ├── strategy: ALGEBRAIC_VIA_AUX

**Annotations per node:**

- Differential strategy (invertible, aux columns, group rescan)
- Auxiliary columns generated and their purpose
- Why a node might force FULL refresh (volatile function, unsupported
  construct)
- Change buffer depth at leaf nodes

**Rendering:** The `OpTree` is serialized as DOT format by the Rust API,
rendered client-side via `graphviz-wasm` or `d3-graphviz`. This matches
the RisingWave approach for `explain_distsql`.

### Column-Level Lineage

pg-trickle's `OpTree` AST contains complete derivation information:
`Scan` nodes with `table_oid` and columns, `Project` nodes with
expressions and aliases, `Aggregate` nodes with `AggExpr`. This enables
tracing any output column back to its source columns.

**Example:** Clicking `revenue_7d.total_revenue` shows:

```
revenue_7d.total_revenue
  └── SUM(orders.amount)
        └── orders.amount (numeric, CDC: trigger)
              └── base table: public.orders, column: amount
```

**Cross-table lineage:** For chained stream tables, the lineage traces
through intermediate stream tables back to base tables. This is the
data catalog feature that teams currently pay for in dbt lineage,
DataHub, or Amundsen — built-in and always up to date.

### Live Change Flow

A real-time view of data moving through the system. Powered by the
`pg_trickle_alert` NOTIFY channel over WebSocket.

Events displayed as a scrolling timeline:
- `orders` table: +1,200 rows captured by CDC trigger
- `revenue_7d` refresh triggered (DIFFERENTIAL, 45ms, +3 rows / -1 row)
- `regional_summary` refresh triggered (DIFFERENTIAL, 12ms, +1 row)
- `summary_outbox`: 1 message published to relay forward pipeline
- Relay forward: message delivered to NATS `analytics.summary`

This is the streaming equivalent of watching Kafka consumer offsets
advance in real time.

### Data Explorer

A stream-table-aware schema browser and data preview. **Not** a general
PostgreSQL browser — scoped to pg-trickle objects only.

**Features:**

- Schema tree: stream tables grouped by schema, source tables with CDC
  badges
- Click a table → column list with types, nullability, PK markers
- "Sample" button: runs `SELECT * FROM ... LIMIT 50` via the API
- Side-by-side: view definition SQL and the compiled delta SQL (from
  `explain_delta()`)
- Staleness badge inline on every table
- Refresh mode badge with tooltip from `explain_refresh_mode()`
- Change buffer preview: pending rows for a source table before the next
  refresh

### SQL Preview Model

Every write action in the WebUI follows the same pattern:

```
User fills form (or LLM agent generates SQL)
    ↓
WebUI renders SQL in a Monaco/code block for review
    ↓
User reviews SQL, optionally edits it
    ↓
"Apply" button executes the SQL against PostgreSQL
    ↓
Result displayed (success + affected rows, or error + explanation)
```

The SQL preview is also the **human review layer for LLM-generated
configuration**. When an agent generates a `CREATE STREAM TABLE`
statement, the WebUI provides the confirmation step — showing exactly
what will be applied before execution. This is more valuable than a
form wizard because LLM output is less predictable than a constrained
form.

**Properties:**

- SQL is the source of truth. The WebUI generates it, never bypasses it.
- Power users copy the SQL into their migration files.
- The preview is educational — users learn the pg-trickle API by using
  the wizard or reviewing agent-generated SQL.
- Every generated SQL statement is idempotent where possible (`IF NOT
  EXISTS`, `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`).
- The `POST /api/v1/sql/preview` endpoint enables agents to validate SQL
  (DVM compatibility, syntax) before proposing it to the user.

### Health Scorecard

Aggregates all `health_check()` results, slot health, change buffer
sizes, and relay pipeline lag into a single page. Severity-sorted.

| Check | Status | Detail | Remediation |
|-------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Scheduler | ✅ Running | 12 tables, 3 workers | — |

| Replication slot | ✅ Active | 2.1 MB retained WAL | — |
| Buffer growth | 🔴 Critical | `orders`: 15,204 rows, growing | [Investigate →] |
| Relay: kafka-fwd | ✅ Connected | 0 lag rows | — |
| Relay: nats-rev | ⚠️ Degraded | 342 lag rows, 12s behind | [View pipeline →] |
| Fuses | ✅ All armed | 0 blown | — |

## LLM Agent Integration & MCP Server

### Impact on Feature Tiers

LLM agents (Copilot, Claude, custom tooling) fundamentally change which
WebUI features are urgent and which are deferrable:

| Feature area | Without agents | With agents | Impact |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|--------|
| **Tier 1: Dashboard / monitoring** | Essential | Essential | No change — visual observability is irreducible |
| **Tier 2: Relay pipeline management** | Essential | Still useful | Forms remain valuable for non-technical users; agents use the API directly |
| **Tier 3: Setup wizard** | Essential for adoption | Largely covered by agents | Deprioritized — agents generate SQL faster than any form wizard |
| **API layer (`/api/v1/`)** | WebUI backend | Agent integration surface | Elevated — must be first-class, stable, well-documented |
| **DVM checker** | Wizard feature | Agent-callable endpoint | Elevated as API; deprioritized as form UI |
| **SQL preview** | Wizard output | Human review layer for agent-generated SQL | Reframed — more valuable, not less |

The durable value of the WebUI is **operational visibility** (topology
graph, SLA monitoring, live change flow, operator inspector). These
features have no LLM substitute — you need to *see* the system to
understand it. The setup/configuration features are increasingly handled
by agents calling the API.

### MCP Server

The `/api/v1/` JSON API is a natural **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**
server. MCP is an open standard for LLM tool integration — each API
endpoint maps to a tool that an agent can discover and call.

The relay ships an MCP-compatible tool manifest at
`GET /api/v1/mcp/tools` that describes all available operations:

```json
{
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "list_stream_tables",
      "description": "List all pg-trickle stream tables with status, staleness, refresh mode, and SLA budget",
      "endpoint": "GET /api/v1/tables",
      "parameters": {}
    },
    {
      "name": "get_topology",
      "description": "Get the full DAG including relay pipeline nodes, with lag and buffer depth per edge",
      "endpoint": "GET /api/v1/dag/topology",
      "parameters": {}
    },
    {
      "name": "check_health",
      "description": "Get health scorecard: scheduler, CDC, slots, buffers, relay pipelines, fuses",
      "endpoint": "GET /api/v1/health",
      "parameters": {}
    },
    {
      "name": "preview_sql",
      "description": "Validate SQL and return DVM compatibility analysis. Returns whether the query supports DIFFERENTIAL refresh and why.",
      "endpoint": "POST /api/v1/sql/preview",
      "parameters": { "sql": "string" }
    },
    {
      "name": "execute_sql",
      "description": "Execute SQL against PostgreSQL. Use preview_sql first to validate.",
      "endpoint": "POST /api/v1/sql/execute",
      "parameters": { "sql": "string" }
    },
    {

      "description": "Get detailed status for a stream table: refresh stats, staleness, refresh mode explanation, column list",
      "endpoint": "GET /api/v1/tables/:name",
      "parameters": { "name": "string" }
    },
    {
      "name": "get_column_lineage",
      "description": "Trace column-level lineage from output columns back to source columns through the full derivation chain",
      "endpoint": "GET /api/v1/tables/:name/lineage",
      "parameters": { "name": "string" }
    },
    {
      "name": "get_relay_pipelines",
      "description": "List all relay pipelines (forward and reverse) with connection status and lag",
      "endpoint": "GET /api/v1/relay/pipelines",
      "parameters": {}
    },
    {
      "name": "diagnose_table",
      "description": "Get diagnostics for a stream table: why it uses FULL vs DIFFERENTIAL refresh, operator tree, change buffer depth",
      "endpoint": "GET /api/v1/tables/:name/operator-tree",
      "parameters": { "name": "string" }
    },
    {
      "name": "trigger_refresh",
      "description": "Trigger an immediate refresh of a stream table",
      "endpoint": "POST /api/v1/tables/:name/refresh",
      "parameters": { "name": "string" }
    },
    {
      "name": "reset_fuse",
      "description": "Reset a blown circuit breaker (fuse) for a stream table",
      "endpoint": "POST /api/v1/fuses/:name/reset",
      "parameters": { "name": "string" }
    }
  ]
}
```

This manifest enables any MCP-compatible agent (VS Code Copilot,
Claude Desktop, custom agents) to discover and use pg-trickle's full
API without custom integration code. The agent sees the tool list,
understands each tool's purpose from the description, and calls the
HTTP endpoints.

**MCP transport options:**

| Transport | Endpoint | Use case |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **HTTP+SSE (Streamable HTTP)** | `POST /api/v1/mcp` | Standard MCP transport. Agents connect over HTTP; server pushes events (alerts, status changes) via SSE. Works through proxies and firewalls. |

**Decision: HTTP+SSE only** for Phase 0.5. This is the simplest and
most firewall-friendly transport. WebSocket and stdio transports can
be added later if demand arises.

**Auth for agents:** Agents authenticate the same way as the WebUI
(see [Authentication](#authentication)). In `none` mode, agents call
the API directly. In `pg` mode, agents pass credentials via HTTP
Basic auth or a session token. In `oidc` mode, agents use a service
account token.

### OpenAPI Specification

The `/api/v1/` layer ships with an OpenAPI 3.1 specification at
`GET /api/v1/openapi.json`. This serves three purposes:

1. **LLM agent integration** — agents can read the spec to understand
   all available endpoints, parameter types, and response schemas
   without hardcoded knowledge.
2. **Client generation** — TypeScript types for the Next.js frontend
   are generated from the spec, ensuring type safety between backend
   and frontend.
3. **Documentation** — Swagger UI at `/api/v1/docs` (behind
   `--features webui`) provides interactive API documentation.

The spec is generated from Rust types using `utoipa` (compile-time
OpenAPI generation from Axum handlers). This ensures the spec is
always in sync with the implementation.

## Comparison with RisingWave Dashboard

pg-trickle's streaming materialization architecture is closely comparable
to RisingWave. The relay's sources and sinks are the equivalent of
RisingWave's built-in source and sink connectors. Stream tables are the
equivalent of materialized views in RisingWave's streaming engine.

| RisingWave Dashboard Feature | pg-trickle WebUI Equivalent |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Materialized Views page | Stream table list + detail |
| Sources page | CDC sources + relay reverse pipelines |
| Sinks page | Relay forward pipelines |
| Fragment graph (backpressure per edge) | Unified topology graph (lag/buffer per edge) |
| Relation graph | DAG view with relay nodes |
| `explain_distsql` (graphviz-wasm) | DVM operator inspector (graphviz-wasm) |
| Await tree | Worker pool + job queue |
| Cluster status | Health scorecard |
| Internal tables | Change buffer inspection |
| Historical backpressure | Refresh timeline + historical lag |

**What pg-trickle adds beyond RisingWave:**

- **SLA budgets** — RisingWave has no concept of freshness SLA because
  it's always-streaming. pg-trickle's scheduled refresh model enables
  explicit SLA thresholds with burn-rate tracking.
- **Cross-cluster relay topology** — The relay can bridge multiple PG
  clusters. The topology graph shows end-to-end flow across clusters
  in a single view — no equivalent in RisingWave's single-system model.
- **Column-level lineage** — derivable from the `OpTree` AST. RisingWave
  does not expose this in the dashboard.
- **SQL preview model** — configuration-by-wizard that generates auditable
  SQL. RisingWave's dashboard is read-only.
- **End-to-end lag through the dependency chain** — cumulative staleness
  from base table through N-level stream table chains. RisingWave shows
  per-fragment backpressure but not pipeline-level cumulative lag.

---

## Sequencing & Dependencies

### Prerequisites

The WebUI is hosted inside `pgtrickle-relay`. The relay must ship first
with:

- `AppState` designed as a proper service state (`Arc<AppState>` with
  PG pool, pipeline registry, metrics handle, shutdown token)
- A single Axum instance shared across health, metrics, webhook
  receiver, and future WebUI routes
- A stubbed `/ui` route returning 200 OK (placeholder for the frontend)
- The JSON API layer (`/api/v1/...`) as the backend for the WebUI

The pg-trickle extension must emit a `pgtrickle_structure_changed`
NOTIFY whenever topology changes: stream table created/dropped,
CDC trigger enabled/disabled, relay pipeline config changed. The relay
listens on this channel alongside `pg_trickle_alert` and uses it to
drive `WsEvent::TopologyChanged` broadcasts. This NOTIFY is cheap
(~2 µs, inside the existing DDL trigger path) and can be added in the
same release as the relay.

### Delivery Phases

| Phase | Content | Depends on |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **Phase 0: API scaffold** | `/api/v1/` routes returning JSON for all read endpoints. OpenAPI spec via `utoipa`. No frontend. Useful immediately for scripting, Grafana, and LLM agents. | Relay core (RELAY-1 through RELAY-4) |
| **Phase 0.5: MCP server** | MCP tool manifest at `/api/v1/mcp/tools`. HTTP+SSE transport at `POST /api/v1/mcp`. Enables LLM agents to discover and use all API endpoints. | Phase 0 |
| **Phase 1: Tier 1 frontend** | Next.js app with: health scorecard, stream table list, topology graph, refresh timeline, alerts, relay pipeline status. Read-only. | Phase 0 |
| **Phase 2: Tier 2 forms** | Relay pipeline create/edit/delete forms with SQL preview. Fuse reset, manual refresh, pause/resume. SQL preview doubles as human review layer for agent-generated SQL. | Phase 1 + relay pipeline config tables |
| **Phase 3: Tier 3 wizard** (deprioritized) | Stream table creation wizard, CDC enablement, Monaco editor. Deferred until user demand — LLM agents cover most setup tasks via the API. Column-level lineage and operator inspector may ship earlier as Tier 1 read-only features. | Phase 2 + OpTree serialization API |

### Relay `AppState` Requirements (Day 1)

The relay scaffold (RELAY-1) must be designed with the WebUI in mind from
the start. Specifically:

```rust
pub struct AppState {
    /// PostgreSQL connection pool (read replicas for API, primary for writes)
    pub pg_pool: PgPool,

    /// Pipeline registry (active forward/reverse pipelines with status)
    pub pipelines: Arc<RwLock<PipelineRegistry>>,

    /// Prometheus metrics handle (shared with relay workers)
    pub metrics: Arc<RelayMetrics>,

    /// Shutdown token (coordinates relay workers + HTTP server)
    pub shutdown: CancellationToken,

    /// WebSocket broadcast channel (NOTIFY alerts, topology changes, state updates)
    /// WsEvent variants:
    ///   StateUpdate { table, staleness_secs, buffer_rows, lag_rows, sla_status }
    ///   TopologyChanged { source: "ddl" | "relay_config" }
    ///   Alert { channel, payload }
    ///   RelayPipelineChanged { pipeline_name, status }
    pub ws_broadcast: broadcast::Sender<WsEvent>,

    /// Configuration (auth mode, log level, feature flags)
    pub config: Arc<RelayConfig>,
}
```

This structure is shared between relay worker tasks and HTTP handlers.
Designing it correctly in RELAY-1 avoids a painful refactor when the
WebUI is added.

### Self-Monitoring via Stream Tables (Dogfooding)

The WebUI uses pg-trickle stream tables to power several of its own
derived metrics. This is the canonical dogfooding use case: the product
monitoring itself, with those monitoring stream tables visible as
first-class nodes in the topology graph.

**Governing rule:** The `/health` endpoint and the live-badge
`WsEvent::StateUpdate` path **always use direct queries** — they must
never depend on stream tables. If the scheduler is stopped or the
extension is degraded, those paths must still work. Stream tables are
only used for **derived aggregate metrics** where a small amount of
staleness is acceptable and the value comes from incremental maintenance
over time.

#### Candidate stream tables

The relay creates these stream tables during its own initialisation
(via `pgtrickle.relay_setup()`), sourced exclusively from stable,
public-facing catalog views and relay-owned sample tables:

| Stream table | Source | WebUI consumer | Refresh mode |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pgtrickle._staleness_samples` | Relay worker polls `get_staleness()`, inserts rows | N/A — source table | N/A |
| `pgtrickle.sla_burn_rate` | `_staleness_samples` (1 h window) | SLA budget progress bars, burn-rate trend arrows | DIFFERENTIAL (`regr_slope` via aux cols) |
| `pgtrickle.refresh_percentiles` | `pgt_refresh_log` (rolling 1 h / 24 h) | Refresh timeline P50/P95/P99 overlays | DIFFERENTIAL (algebraic aggregates) |
| `pgtrickle.buffer_growth_rate` | `_staleness_samples` (derivative per table) | Buffer depth trend badges | DIFFERENTIAL |
| `pgtrickle.end_to_end_lag` | `pg_stat_stream_tables` + DAG edges | Topology graph edge widths | FULL (recursive CTE — upgraded when recursive IVM ships) |

#### Example: `sla_burn_rate`

The relay inserts a staleness sample for each stream table every
`pg_trickle.relay_sample_interval` seconds (default 15 s):

```sql
-- Source table: populated by the relay worker, not user-managed
CREATE TABLE pgtrickle._staleness_samples (
    sampled_at  timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    table_name  text        NOT NULL,
    staleness_s float4      NOT NULL
);

-- Stream table: rolling SLA burn rate, refreshed every 15 s
CREATE STREAM TABLE pgtrickle.sla_burn_rate AS
SELECT
    table_name,
    avg(staleness_s)                                            AS mean_staleness_s,
    max(staleness_s)                                            AS max_staleness_s,
    regr_slope(staleness_s, extract(epoch FROM sampled_at))     AS staleness_trend_s_per_s,
    count(*)                                                    AS sample_count
FROM pgtrickle._staleness_samples
WHERE sampled_at > now() - interval '1 hour'
GROUP BY table_name;
SCHEDULE '15 seconds';
```

`staleness_trend_s_per_s` is the burn rate: a value of `0.5` means the
table is gaining half a second of staleness for every wall-clock second
elapsed. Given a 30 s SLA and current staleness of 20 s, it will breach
in `(30 − 20) / 0.5 = 20 s`. This is exactly the value the SLA budget
progress bar displays as remaining budget.

The aggregate uses `regr_slope()`, which is algebraic and maintained
incremantally by the DVM engine via auxiliary sum/count columns — no
full-table rescan on each 15 s tick.

#### Meta-observability property

Because these stream tables are registered in `pgt_stream_tables`, they
appear in the topology graph as first-class nodes. An SRE investigating
a staleness spike can see at a glance whether `sla_burn_rate` itself is
stale — meaning the burn-rate indicators in the WebUI are running on
outdated data. The monitoring is transparent about its own freshness.
No external monitoring tool provides this self-describing property.

Further: clicking the `sla_burn_rate` node in the topology graph opens
the DVM operator inspector showing the `regr_slope` aggregate strategy,
its auxiliary columns, and the current change buffer depth of
`_staleness_samples`. The observability stack is fully introspectable.

#### Bootstrap safety rule

| Data path | Source | Stream table allowed? |
|---|---|---|
| `/health` endpoint | `health_check()` — direct query | **No** |
| `WsEvent::StateUpdate` live badges | NOTIFY + direct queries | **No** |
| SLA burn rate chart | `pgtrickle.sla_burn_rate` | **Yes** |
| Refresh percentiles overlay | `pgtrickle.refresh_percentiles` | **Yes** |
| Topology edge width (throughput) | `pgtrickle.end_to_end_lag` | **Yes** (with polling fallback to direct query) |
| Buffer depth badge (live) | Direct `change_buffer_sizes()` | **No** |
| Buffer growth trend line | `pgtrickle.buffer_growth_rate` | **Yes** |

The invariant: anything that must work when the scheduler is stopped or
the extension is degraded uses direct queries. Derived, time-aggregated,
trend data uses stream tables.

## Open Questions

### OQ-1: Naming

The binary currently planned as `pgtrickle-relay` is now the operational
companion process — relay + dashboard + management console. Should it be
renamed?

| Option | Reads as |
|--------|----------|
| `pgtrickle-relay` | "A relay tool that happens to have a UI" |
| `pgtrickle-server` | "The companion server process for pg-trickle" |
| `pgtrickle-ctl` | "The control/admin binary" |

**Current recommendation:** Keep `pgtrickle-relay` for the initial relay
release. Rename to `pgtrickle-server` when the WebUI ships, if the
scope warrants it.

### OQ-2: Separate repo for the frontend

The Next.js frontend could live in `pgtrickle-relay/dashboard/` (monorepo)
or a separate `pgtrickle-dashboard` repo. Monorepo is simpler for CI and
versioning. Separate repo allows independent frontend releases.

**Current recommendation:** Monorepo (`pgtrickle-relay/dashboard/`),
matching RisingWave's approach.

### OQ-3: SLA schema design

~~Should SLA thresholds be:

- (a) A column on `pgtrickle.pgt_stream_tables` (`sla_max_staleness_seconds`)
- (b) A separate `pgtrickle.pgt_sla_config` table
- (c) Inferred only from the schedule interval (no explicit config)~~

**Decision: (c) Inferred only.** SLA thresholds are derived from the
schedule interval: staleness > 2× schedule = warning, > 3× = breach.
No schema changes required. Explicit SLA configuration can be added
later if users need custom thresholds per table.

### OQ-4: Multi-database visibility

~~The relay connects to one PostgreSQL database. Should the WebUI support
connecting to multiple databases simultaneously (e.g., for cross-cluster
topology visualization)?~~

**Decision: Single database only.** The WebUI connects to the same
PostgreSQL database as the relay. Cross-cluster topology visualization
is deferred — it significantly increases scope (connection management,
auth per cluster, merged DAG). Can be revisited when relay-to-relay
bridging is implemented.

### OQ-5: Dark mode

The TUI is terminal-themed by nature. The WebUI should support dark mode
(developer preference). Should it be the default?

### OQ-6: Mobile / responsive

The SRE on-call use case implies phone/tablet access. Should Tier 1 be
responsive, or is desktop-only acceptable initially?

### OQ-7: Embedding in other tools

Should the WebUI be embeddable as an iframe in Grafana dashboards or
internal portals? This affects CSP headers and auth token forwarding.

### OQ-8: API stability

~~The `/api/v1/` routes will be consumed by the WebUI frontend, but also
potentially by scripts and third-party tools. Should the API be treated
as a public contract with semver guarantees from Phase 0?~~

**Decision: Yes.** The API is a first-class integration surface for LLM
agents, automation scripts, and the WebUI frontend. It ships with an
OpenAPI 3.1 spec and follows semver: breaking changes require `/api/v2/`.
This is critical because LLM agents and MCP clients depend on stable
schemas to function correctly.

### OQ-9: TUI deprecation timeline

The TUI (`pgtrickle-tui`) will eventually be superseded by the WebUI.
When should the TUI be deprecated? After Tier 1 feature parity? After
Tier 2?

### OQ-10: MCP protocol version

~~MCP is evolving rapidly. Should the relay target a specific MCP spec
version (e.g., 2025-03-26), or implement a minimal subset (tool
discovery + HTTP+SSE transport) and extend as the spec stabilizes?~~

**Decision: HTTP+SSE only.** Phase 0.5 implements a single MCP
transport: Streamable HTTP (HTTP+SSE). This is the simplest,
most firewall-friendly option and covers remote agents, CI/CD
pipelines, and browser-based tools. stdio transport (for local agents)
and raw WebSocket can be added later if needed.

### OQ-12: Large-deployment UI scalability — schema-based semantic zoom

~~pg-trickle can scale to 1000+ stream tables. The WebUI's topology
graph and list views must handle this, but the right approach is an
open design question.~~

**Decision: Multi-level semantic zoom using schemas only.** The topology
graph groups all objects — including inbox and outbox tables — by
PostgreSQL schema. No new metadata, no JSONB parsing, no naming
conventions required.

**Single grouping axis: PostgreSQL schemas.** Every PG object (stream
table, base table, inbox table, outbox table) has exactly one schema
via `pg_class.relnamespace`. That schema IS the group. External relay
endpoints (Kafka brokers, NATS servers) are simple leaf nodes on the
edge of the schema that contains their inbox/outbox table — they show
backend type and connection status but are not separately grouped or
named.

**Level 0 — Systems overview (hub-and-spoke).** One node per schema.
Each schema node shows: object count, aggregate SLA status (worst
child), pipeline count on connecting edges. External relay endpoints
appear as leaf circles attached to the schemas that contain their
inbox/outbox tables. Multiple inboxes feeding the same schema
(Kafka + webhook + file, all writing into `erp_raw`) each get their
own leaf circle — but the schema is the single named node answering
"Is ERP data healthy?" This view is always readable regardless of
total object count.

on right: relay forward pipeline endpoints. Multiple endpoints on the
same side of a schema are shown as a stack of circles. Layout
position is auto-inferred: schemas that contain only base tables and
relay inboxes are placed left; schemas with outboxes and relay
forwards are placed
right; everything else is center. No configuration required.

**Level 1 — Schema detail.** Click a schema group → shows all individual
nodes within that schema, with edges to adjacent schemas and to the
external relay endpoints. Supports **partial pipelines**: clicking the
edge between `erp_raw` and `canonical` shows only the flows between
those two schemas.

**Level 2 — Individual flow.** Click a specific flow → full pipeline
detail (every node with staleness, buffer depth, SLA). Same as the
pipeline detail view.

**Fallback for no grouping.** If all objects are in the `public` schema
and no relay connections are configured, the topology renders a flat
graph with all individual nodes directly. No extra clicks required for
small deployments.

**Why schemas only, not a custom grouping table.** Schemas are
PostgreSQL's native organizational primitive. They align with dbt's
`schema` config, data vault patterns (raw/business vault schemas),
medallion architecture (bronze/silver/gold), and standard access
control (`GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA`). Inbox and outbox tables already
live in meaningful schemas by convention — no additional metadata
needed to group them.

**API support:**

### OQ-11: Agent guardrails

~~Should the API enforce guardrails for agent-initiated writes? For
example: require a `X-Agent-Name` header on `POST /api/v1/sql/execute`
so the audit log records which agent made each change, or require
`preview_sql` to be called before `execute_sql` for non-human callers.~~

**Decision: Both guardrails.**

1. **`X-Agent-Name` header** — optional but logged. If present on any
   write endpoint, the agent name is recorded in the audit log
   alongside the SQL and result. Helps operators trace "who changed
   this stream table?" back to a specific agent.
2. **`preview_sql` before `execute_sql`** — the `POST /api/v1/sql/execute`
   endpoint accepts an optional `preview_token` returned by
   `POST /api/v1/sql/preview`. When provided, execute validates that
   the SQL matches the previewed statement. This is not enforced
   (agents can skip it), but the audit log records whether a preview
   was performed. This encourages the safe pattern (validate → review
   → apply) without blocking automation that needs to skip it.

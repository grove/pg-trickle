# Performance & Scalability — New Feature Research Report

> Date: 2026-03-12
> Status: Research / Proposal
> Scope: High-level features for performance and scalability beyond current plans

---

## Executive Summary

This report identifies **12 high-level performance and scalability features**
not yet covered by existing plans (Parts 8–9, parallelization report, TPC-H
plan). Features are grouped into four themes:

1. **Reduce the MERGE bottleneck** — The 70–97% hotspot
2. **Smarter delta computation** — Do less work per refresh cycle
3. **Scale to larger deployments** — 100+ STs, multi-TB databases, multi-tenant
4. **Reduce CDC overhead** — Lighter change capture on the write path

Each feature includes a description, rationale, expected impact, effort
estimate, and references to prior art from Feldera, Noria/ReadySet, DBSP,
Flink, and academic literature.

---

## Theme A — Reduce the MERGE Bottleneck

Per Part 8 profiling, PostgreSQL `MERGE` execution dominates 70–97% of refresh
time. The MERGE statement joins the delta CTE against the stream table, then
performs INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE. Every feature in this theme attacks that cost
from a different angle.

### A-1: Partitioned Stream Tables (Partition-Scoped MERGE)

**Problem.** When a stream table has 10M+ rows, the MERGE scans the entire
target table even when the delta touches only a handful of partitions.
PostgreSQL's MERGE does support partition pruning, but only if the target is
declaratively partitioned and the join predicate aligns with the partition key.

**Proposal.** When the user defines a stream table with `PARTITION BY` on the
source or explicitly on the stream table:

1. Auto-create the stream table as a partitioned table (RANGE or LIST on the
   declared partition key).
2. At refresh time, inspect the delta to determine which partitions are
   affected (scan the delta CTE for `min/max` of the partition key).
3. Rewrite the MERGE to target only the affected partitions using a
   `WHERE partition_key BETWEEN ? AND ?` predicate that enables partition
   pruning.
4. For cold partitions (no changes), skip entirely — zero-cost.

**Expected Impact.** For a 10M-row stream table partitioned into 100
partitions with a 0.1% change rate concentrated in 2–3 partitions, the MERGE
scans ~100K rows instead of 10M — **100× reduction** in MERGE I/O.

**Effort.** 3–5 weeks (DDL changes, partition detection, MERGE rewrite).

**Prior Art.** Flink's partitioned state backends; TimescaleDB hypertable
chunk-scoped operations; Materialize's partitioned arrangements.

---

### A-2: Columnar Change Tracking (Column-Scoped Delta)

**Problem.** When a source table UPDATE changes only 1 of 50 columns, the
current CDC captures the entire row (old + new) and the delta query processes
all columns. If the changed column is not referenced by the stream table's
defining query, the entire refresh is wasted work.

**Proposal.** Track per-column change metadata:

1. In the CDC trigger, compute a bitmask of actually-changed columns
   (`old.col IS DISTINCT FROM new.col` for each column) and store it as an
   `int8` or `bit(n)` alongside the change row.
2. At delta-query build time, consult the bitmask:
   - If no referenced column changed → **skip the row entirely** (filter in
     the `delta_scan` CTE).
   - If only projected columns changed (no join keys, no filter predicates,
     no aggregate keys) → use a lightweight UPDATE-only path instead of
     full DELETE+INSERT.
3. For aggregates, if only the aggregated value column changed (not the GROUP
   BY key), emit a single correction row instead of two (delete old group +
   insert new group).

**Expected Impact.** In OLTP workloads where UPDATEs dominate and typically
touch 1–3 columns of wide tables: **50–90% reduction in delta row volume**
for wide-table scenarios.

**Effort.** 3–4 weeks (trigger changes, bitmask propagation, delta CTE
generation changes).

**Prior Art.** Oracle's column-change tracking in materialized view logs;
Feldera's per-field Z-set weights; DBToaster's multi-level deltas.

---

### A-3: MERGE Bypass via Direct INSERT OVERWRITE

**Problem.** PostgreSQL's MERGE planner can choose suboptimal join strategies,
especially for small deltas against large target tables. The MERGE also
imposes overhead from its three-way MATCHED/NOT MATCHED/NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE
logic.

**Proposal.** For specific operator tree shapes, bypass MERGE entirely:

1. **Append-Only Stream Tables.** When the defining query references only
   INSERT-only sources (e.g., event logs, append-only tables where CDC never
   sees DELETE/UPDATE), skip the MERGE entirely and use a simple
   `INSERT INTO st SELECT ... FROM delta`.

2. **Full-Replacement Window.** When the stream table has TopK semantics
   (ORDER BY + LIMIT) with a small limit (< 10K), use
   `TRUNCATE st; INSERT INTO st SELECT ... FROM (full_query) LIMIT N`.
   This is faster than MERGE when the target is small and the delta can
   recompute cheaply.

3. **Bulk COPY Path.** When the delta produces > 10K rows (high change rate
   but below adaptive-FULL threshold), switch to:
   ```
   DELETE FROM st WHERE __pgt_row_id IN (SELECT __pgt_row_id FROM delta WHERE action='D');
   COPY st FROM (SELECT ... FROM delta WHERE action='I');
   ```
   COPY is 2–5× faster than INSERT for bulk loads due to bypassing
   per-row executor overhead.

**Expected Impact.** 30–70% MERGE time reduction for qualifying scenarios.
Append-only path eliminates MERGE entirely for event-sourced architectures.

**Effort.** 2–3 weeks (path selection logic, template variants, benchmarks).

**Prior Art.** Snowflake's MERGE vs INSERT OVERWRITE cost-based selection;
DuckDB's bulk COPY path; Redshift's MERGE alternatives.

---

### A-4: Index-Aware MERGE Planning

**Problem.** The MERGE joins delta against the stream table on `__pgt_row_id`.
If the stream table lacks an index on this column (it currently has one, but
the planner may not use it for small deltas), PostgreSQL may choose a
sequential scan.

**Proposal.**

1. **MERGE planner hints injection.** Extend `pg_trickle.merge_planner_hints`
   to automatically include:
   - `SET enable_seqscan = off` when `delta_row_count < 0.01 * target_count`
   - Index hints (PG 18 planner hints extension) pointing to the
     `__pgt_row_id` index.
2. **Covering index auto-creation.** When a stream table is created, if the
   defining query's output columns are small enough (< 8 columns), create a
   covering index `INCLUDE (col1, col2, ...)` on `__pgt_row_id` to enable
   index-only scans during MERGE. This eliminates the heap-fetch for matched
   rows.
3. **Partial index for hot partitions.** For time-series stream tables, create
   a partial index on `__pgt_row_id WHERE updated_at > now() - interval '1 day'`
   to keep the index small and hot.

**Expected Impact.** 20–50% MERGE time reduction for small-delta/large-target
scenarios where the planner currently chooses seq-scan.

**Effort.** 1–2 weeks (planner hint logic, auto-index DDL).

**Prior Art.** pg_hint_plan; Oracle's materialized view log indexes;
SQL Server's indexed views with clustered index selection.

---

## Theme B — Smarter Delta Computation

These features reduce the amount of work the DVM engine and PostgreSQL do
per refresh cycle, independent of the MERGE step.

### B-1: Incremental Aggregate Maintenance (Algebraic Shortcuts)

**Problem.** The current aggregate delta rule recomputes entire groups where
the GROUP BY key appears in the delta. For a group with 100K rows where 1 row
changed, the aggregate re-scans all 100K rows in that group.

**Proposal.** Implement algebraic aggregate maintenance for decomposable
aggregates:

| Aggregate | Algebraic Maintenance | Aux State |
|-----------|-----------------------|-----------|
| COUNT     | `old_count + Δcount` | Single counter |
| SUM       | `old_sum + Δsum` | Single accumulator |
| AVG       | `(old_sum + Δsum) / (old_count + Δcount)` | Sum + count |
| MIN/MAX   | If deleted value ≠ current min/max → no rescan | Current min/max + count-at-min |
| STDDEV    | Online Welford update | Mean + M2 + count |

Implementation:
1. Add auxiliary columns to the stream table: `__pgt_aux_count`,
   `__pgt_aux_sum`, etc. (hidden from user queries via view wrapper).
2. Delta query emits correction values instead of full group recomputation:
   ```sql
   UPDATE st SET
     total_amount = total_amount + delta.sum_amount,
     row_count = row_count + delta.count_change,
     avg_amount = (total_amount + delta.sum_amount) /
                  NULLIF(row_count + delta.count_change, 0)
   WHERE st.group_key = delta.group_key
   ```
3. Fall back to full-group recomputation for non-decomposable aggregates
   (mode, percentile, string_agg with ordering).

**Expected Impact.** For high-cardinality GROUP BY with large groups:
**10–1000× speedup** per aggregate group (from O(group_size) to O(1)).
Benchmarks show aggregate scenarios at 100K/1% go from 2.5ms to sub-1ms.

**Effort.** 4–6 weeks (auxiliary column management, algebraic rules per
aggregate, fallback logic, correctness tests).

**Prior Art.** DBSP's linear operator lifting; DBToaster's higher-order
maintenance; Feldera's in-memory aggregate state; Noria's partial state.

**Risk.** Auxiliary columns increase storage. Need migration story for
existing stream tables. Floating-point aggregates may accumulate rounding
errors over many cycles (periodic recomputation to reset).

---

### B-2: Delta Predicate Pushdown

**Problem.** The delta CTE chain processes all changes, then filters. For a
query like `SELECT ... FROM orders WHERE status = 'shipped'`, if a change row
has `status = 'pending'`, the delta processes it through scan → filter → discard.
The scan and any join work is wasted.

**Proposal.** Push WHERE predicates from the defining query down into the
change buffer scan:

1. During OpTree construction, identify `Filter` nodes whose predicates
   reference only columns from a single source table.
2. Inject these predicates into the `delta_scan` CTE as additional WHERE
   clauses:
   ```sql
   -- Before: scans all changes, filters later
   delta_scan_orders AS (
     SELECT * FROM pgtrickle_changes.changes_12345
     WHERE lsn BETWEEN ? AND ?
   )

   -- After: filters at scan time
   delta_scan_orders AS (
     SELECT * FROM pgtrickle_changes.changes_12345
     WHERE lsn BETWEEN ? AND ?
       AND (new_status = 'shipped' OR old_status = 'shipped')
   )
   ```
3. The `OR old_status = 'shipped'` handles deletions from the filter's
   qualifying set (a row that was 'shipped' and is now 'pending' must be
   removed from the stream table).

**Expected Impact.** For selective queries (< 10% selectivity),
**5–10× reduction in delta row volume** before any join processing.

**Effort.** 2–3 weeks (predicate extraction, pushdown rules, correctness
for UPDATE scenarios where old/new may differ).

**Prior Art.** Standard RDBMS predicate pushdown; Flink's filter pushdown
into source connectors; Materialize's predicate pushdown through arrangements.

---

### B-3: Multi-Table Delta Batching

**Problem.** When a stream table joins tables A, B, and C, and all three have
changes in the same cycle, the current delta query generates:
```
ΔQ = (ΔA ⋈ B₁ ⋈ C₁) ∪ (A₀ ⋈ ΔB ⋈ C₁) ∪ (A₀ ⋈ B₀ ⋈ ΔC)
```
This requires 3 separate passes through the source tables with different
snapshots.

**Proposal.** Optimize multi-source delta by:

1. **Simultaneous delta merging.** When Δ is small relative to base tables,
   precompute a merged delta:
   ```sql
   merged_delta AS (
     SELECT 'A' AS src, * FROM delta_A
     UNION ALL
     SELECT 'B' AS src, * FROM delta_B
     UNION ALL
     SELECT 'C' AS src, * FROM delta_C
   )
   ```
   Then run a single join pass that handles all source changes together.

2. **Change-ordering optimization.** Within a single cycle, if table A has 0
   changes but B has 100, skip the A-delta branch entirely (already
   implemented via no-change short-circuit), but extend this to skip
   individual UNION ALL branches within a multi-source delta.

3. **Cross-delta deduplication.** When ΔA and ΔB produce the same output row
   (e.g., both sides of a join changed), the current approach may produce
   duplicate corrections. Add a final `DISTINCT ON (__pgt_row_id)` only when
   the optimizer detects diamond-shaped delta flow.

**Expected Impact.** For multi-join queries with changes in multiple sources:
**30–50% reduction in total I/O** by eliminating redundant base-table scans.

**Effort.** 4–6 weeks (delta branch pruning, merged delta generation,
correctness proofs for simultaneous changes).

**Prior Art.** DBSP's simultaneous delta processing; DBToaster's factorized
evaluation; Materialize's shared arrangements.

---

### B-4: Cost-Based Refresh Strategy Selection

**Problem.** The adaptive FULL/DIFFERENTIAL threshold is currently a fixed
ratio (`pg_trickle.differential_max_change_ratio` default 0.5). This is a
blunt instrument — a join-heavy query may be better off with FULL at 5% change
rate, while a scan-only query benefits from DIFFERENTIAL up to 80%.

**Proposal.** Replace the fixed threshold with a cost-based optimizer:

1. **Collect statistics per ST.** After each refresh, record:
   - `delta_row_count` (already tracked)
   - `merge_duration_ms` (already tracked)
   - `full_refresh_duration_ms` (tracked from FULL refreshes)
   - `target_row_count` (already tracked)
   - `query_complexity_class` (scan/filter/aggregate/join/join_agg)

2. **Build a cost model.** Using historical data from `pgt_refresh_history`:
   ```
   estimated_diff_cost(Δ) = α × Δ_rows + β × target_rows + γ × complexity
   estimated_full_cost    = δ × target_rows + ε × complexity
   ```
   Fit α, β, γ, δ, ε via linear regression on the last N refreshes.

3. **Select strategy per cycle.** Before each refresh:
   ```
   IF estimated_diff_cost(current_Δ) < estimated_full_cost × safety_margin:
     USE DIFFERENTIAL
   ELSE:
     USE FULL
   ```
   Safety margin (default 0.8) ensures we prefer DIFFERENTIAL even when costs
   are close, since it has lower lock contention.

4. **Cold-start heuristic.** Before enough data is collected (< 10 refreshes),
   use the current fixed threshold as fallback.

**Expected Impact.** Eliminates the join_agg 100K/10% regression (0.3×) by
correctly falling back to FULL. Improves scan/filter scenarios by allowing
DIFFERENTIAL at higher change rates. **5–20% overall throughput improvement**
across mixed workloads.

**Effort.** 2–3 weeks (statistics collection, cost model, strategy selector).

**Prior Art.** PostgreSQL's query planner cost model; Oracle's cost-based
refresh decision for materialized views; SQL Server's indexed-view maintenance
cost estimation.

## Theme C — Scale to Larger Deployments

These features address operational scalability: supporting 100+ stream tables,
multi-TB databases, and multi-tenant environments.

### C-1: Tiered Refresh Scheduling (Hot/Warm/Cold)

**Problem.** Current scheduling treats all STs equally — each runs on its
configured schedule regardless of how stale the data actually is or how
frequently it's queried. In a deployment with 500 STs, refreshing all of them
every few seconds wastes CPU on STs that nobody is reading.

**Proposal.** Implement demand-driven tiered scheduling:

1. **Query tracking.** Use `pg_stat_user_tables` to track `seq_scan` and
   `idx_scan` counts on each stream table. Periodically sample these counters
   to determine read frequency.

2. **Tier classification:**
   | Tier | Read Frequency | Refresh Strategy |
   |------|---------------|-----------------|
   | **Hot** | > 10 reads/min | Refresh at configured schedule |
   | **Warm** | 1–10 reads/min | Refresh at 2× configured schedule |
   | **Cold** | < 1 read/min | Refresh only on-demand (lazy) |
   | **Frozen** | 0 reads in last hour | Skip entirely; refresh on first read |

3. **Lazy refresh trigger.** For Cold/Frozen STs, install a lightweight
   `pg_stat_user_tables` polling check. When a read is detected, queue an
   immediate refresh. Optionally, use PostgreSQL's `track_io_timing` or a
   custom hook to detect the first sequential scan.

4. **Configurable per-ST.** Allow `ALTER STREAM TABLE ... SET (tier = 'hot')`
   to override automatic classification.

**Expected Impact.** In a 500-ST deployment where 80% are Cold/Frozen:
**80% reduction in scheduler CPU** and background worker utilization.
Hot STs see no degradation.

**Effort.** 3–4 weeks (tier classification, lazy refresh trigger, scheduler
integration).

**Prior Art.** Materialize's on-demand clusters; Oracle's query-driven refresh;
Flink's idle source detection.

**Risk.** Lazy refresh introduces latency on first read after changes. Need a
`pg_trickle.lazy_refresh_timeout` GUC to bound maximum read latency.

---

### C-2: Incremental DAG Rebuild

**Problem.** When any DDL change occurs (detected via `DAG_REBUILD_SIGNAL`),
the entire dependency graph is rebuilt from scratch by querying
`pgt_dependencies`. For 1000+ STs this becomes expensive (O(V+E) SPI queries).

**Proposal.** Implement incremental DAG maintenance:

1. **Delta-based rebuild.** When `DAG_REBUILD_SIGNAL` fires, record which
   specific ST was affected (store the `pgt_id` in shared memory alongside
   the signal counter).
2. Add/remove only the affected edges and vertices, then re-run topological
   sort only on the affected subgraph.
3. Cache the sorted schedule in shared memory (currently recomputed each
   cycle).

**Expected Impact.** DAG rebuild from O(V+E) to O(Δ_V + Δ_E) — typically
O(1) for single-ST DDL changes. Reduces scheduler latency spike from
~50ms to ~1ms at 1000 STs.

**Effort.** 2–3 weeks (incremental topo-sort, shared memory changes).

**Prior Art.** Flink's incremental job graph updates; Spark's adaptive query
re-optimization.

---

### C-3: Multi-Database Scheduler Isolation

**Problem.** The current launcher spawns one scheduler per database, but all
schedulers share a single cluster-wide worker budget
(`pg_trickle.max_dynamic_refresh_workers`). In multi-tenant deployments, one
busy database can starve others.

**Proposal.**

1. **Per-database worker quotas.** Add
   `pg_trickle.per_database_worker_quota` (default: equal share of
   `max_dynamic_refresh_workers`). Allow DBA to configure per-database:
   ```sql
   ALTER DATABASE analytics SET pg_trickle.worker_quota = 8;
   ALTER DATABASE reporting SET pg_trickle.worker_quota = 2;
   ```

2. **Priority-based scheduling.** When worker demand exceeds budget, use
   priority ordering:
   - Priority 1: STs with IMMEDIATE mode (transactional consistency)
   - Priority 2: Hot-tier STs (high read frequency)
   - Priority 3: Warm-tier STs
   - Priority 4: Cold-tier STs

3. **Burst capacity.** Allow databases to temporarily exceed their quota
   (up to 150%) if other databases are under-utilizing theirs. Reclaim
   burst capacity within 1 scheduler cycle.

**Expected Impact.** Prevents noisy-neighbor problems in multi-tenant
deployments. Ensures SLA compliance for high-priority databases.

**Effort.** 2–3 weeks (quota tracking in shared memory, priority queue,
burst logic).

**Prior Art.** Kubernetes resource quotas; YARN capacity scheduler;
PostgreSQL's per-database connection limits.

---

### C-4: Change Buffer Compaction

**Problem.** The change buffer tables (`pgtrickle_changes.changes_<oid>`) grow
unboundedly between refresh cycles. For high-write tables with long refresh
intervals, buffers can reach millions of rows, making the delta scan expensive.
Additionally, UPDATE operations produce two rows (DELETE old + INSERT new),
doubling the buffer size.

**Proposal.** Implement periodic compaction of change buffers:

1. **Row-level compaction.** Between refresh cycles, merge multiple changes to
   the same row ID into a single net change:
   - INSERT + DELETE = no-op (remove both)
   - INSERT + UPDATE = INSERT (with final values)
   - UPDATE + UPDATE = single UPDATE (with final values)
   - UPDATE + DELETE = DELETE (with original values)

2. **Trigger.** Run compaction when buffer size exceeds
   `pg_trickle.compact_threshold` (default: 100K rows per buffer) or at a
   configurable interval.

3. **Implementation.** Use a single SQL statement:
   ```sql
   WITH ranked AS (
     SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
       PARTITION BY __pgt_row_id ORDER BY lsn DESC
     ) AS rn
   FROM changes_<oid>
   WHERE lsn >= frontier_lsn
   )
   DELETE FROM changes_<oid> WHERE ctid NOT IN (
     SELECT ctid FROM ranked WHERE rn = 1
   )
   ```

4. **Net-zero detection.** When compaction discovers that a row was inserted
   and then deleted within the same cycle, eliminate both rows — the refresh
   need not process them at all.

**Expected Impact.** For high-churn tables with long refresh intervals:
**50–90% reduction in change buffer size**, proportional reduction in delta
scan time. Major benefit for `join` scenarios where delta size dominates.

**Effort.** 2–3 weeks (compaction logic, trigger integration, concurrency
safety).

**Prior Art.** LSM-tree compaction (RocksDB, LevelDB); Kafka log compaction;
Materialize's compaction of arrangements; HBase major/minor compaction.

**Risk.** Compaction itself has a cost. Must ensure it doesn't run during an
active refresh cycle (use advisory locks). Compaction on UNLOGGED tables is
simpler but loses crash safety for intermediate states.

---

## Theme D — Reduce CDC Overhead

These features target the write-side cost of change data capture, reducing the
impact of pg_trickle on OLTP write throughput.

### D-1: UNLOGGED Change Buffers

**Problem.** Change buffer tables are currently logged (WAL-written). Every
INSERT into a change buffer generates WAL records, doubling the WAL volume
for the source table's writes. This is especially painful for high-write
workloads.

**Proposal.** Make change buffer tables UNLOGGED:

1. Create change buffers as `CREATE UNLOGGED TABLE pgtrickle_changes.changes_<oid>`.
2. After a crash, change buffers are empty (PostgreSQL truncates UNLOGGED
   tables on recovery). This is acceptable because:
   - The next refresh cycle will fall back to FULL mode (no changes = no
     frontier advancement, triggering reinit).
   - Stream table data is still intact (it's a regular logged table).
3. Add a `pg_trickle.unlogged_buffers` GUC (default: `true`) to control this.

**Expected Impact.** **~30% reduction in WAL volume** from CDC triggers.
For write-heavy workloads (> 10K writes/sec), this translates to measurably
lower replication lag and checkpoint pressure.

**Effort.** 1–2 weeks (DDL changes, crash recovery handling, GUC).

**Prior Art.** Mentioned in PLAN_TPC_H_BENCHMARKING.md as O-3. PostgreSQL's
UNLOGGED tables; Oracle's NOLOGGING mode for materialized view logs.

**Risk.** After crash, one FULL refresh per ST is required. For most workloads
this is acceptable. Users who need crash-safe change buffers can set
`pg_trickle.unlogged_buffers = false`.

---

### D-2: Async CDC via Logical Decoding Output Plugin

**Problem.** The current WAL CDC mode uses `pgoutput` (standard logical
replication protocol) which requires a replication slot and a background
worker polling for changes. The polling interval introduces latency and the
replication slot retains WAL segments.

**Proposal.** Develop a custom logical decoding output plugin
(`pg_trickle_decoder`) that:

1. **Direct buffer writes.** Instead of decoding WAL → logical messages →
   polling → buffer insert, decode WAL directly into the change buffer table
   in a single step within the output plugin callback.
2. **Filtered decoding.** Only decode tables that are sources of active stream
   tables (skip all other tables in the WAL stream). This reduces CPU from
   decoding irrelevant tables.
3. **Batched output.** Accumulate decoded rows and flush in batches of 1000+
   rows using `SPI_exec` within the plugin, amortizing per-row overhead.

**Expected Impact.** **50–80% reduction in WAL decoding CPU** compared to
pgoutput polling. Eliminates the polling latency (changes appear in buffer
within ~10ms of WAL write instead of at the next poll interval).

**Effort.** 6–8 weeks (C-based output plugin, pgrx integration, testing).

**Prior Art.** wal2json, pgoutput, test_decoding (PostgreSQL built-in);
Debezium's custom output plugins; pg_logical's direct decoding.

**Risk.** High complexity. C code in PostgreSQL output plugin requires careful
memory management. Must handle transactions that span multiple WAL segments.
Consider as a v1.0+ feature.

---

### D-3: Write-Batched CDC Triggers

**Problem.** Even with statement-level triggers (v0.4.0), each DML statement
invokes the trigger function once. For COPY operations that insert 100K rows,
the trigger processes all 100K transition-table rows in a single function call,
which is good — but the trigger overhead is still per-statement.

**Proposal.** Optimize the CDC trigger function for batch scenarios:

1. **Bulk COPY path.** Detect when the trigger is processing > 1000 rows
   (via `SELECT count(*) FROM new_table`) and switch to a bulk-optimized
   path:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO pgtrickle_changes.changes_<oid>
   SELECT nextval('...'), pg_current_wal_lsn(), 'I',
          <pk_cols>, <tracked_cols>
   FROM new_table;
   ```
   Skip per-row hashing and row-ID computation; use a set-returning insert.

2. **Deferred hashing.** For bulk operations, defer content hashing to
   refresh time instead of trigger time. Store raw rows in the change buffer;
   compute hashes lazily when the delta query runs.

3. **Adaptive trigger complexity.** For narrow tables (< 5 columns) with
   simple PKs, use a minimal trigger function that skips JSON serialization
   and stores typed columns directly.

**Expected Impact.** **20–40% reduction in trigger overhead** for bulk DML
operations. Larger gains for wide tables.

**Effort.** 2–3 weeks (trigger function variants, adaptive selection).

**Prior Art.** pgaudit's minimal-overhead logging; Debezium's batched
snapshot mode.

---

### D-4: Shared Change Buffers (Multi-ST Deduplication)

**Problem.** When multiple stream tables reference the same source table,
each has its own change buffer. A single INSERT into the source table triggers
N independent change buffer writes (one per dependent ST). For 10 STs
referencing the same source, write amplification is 10×.

**Proposal.** Share change buffers across STs that reference the same source:

1. **Single buffer per source.** Instead of `changes_<st_oid>`, use
   `changes_<source_oid>` (already partially implemented in CDC mode).
2. **Reference counting.** Track which STs have consumed changes via the
   frontier (already tracked per-ST in `pgt_dependencies.decoder_confirmed_lsn`).
3. **Cleanup coordination.** Only delete change buffer rows when ALL
   dependent STs have advanced their frontier past them.
4. **Column superset.** The shared buffer stores the union of columns needed
   by all dependent STs. Each ST's delta scan projects only the columns it
   needs.

**Expected Impact.** For N STs referencing the same source:
**N× reduction in change buffer write volume**, proportional reduction in
trigger overhead and WAL volume.

**Effort.** 3–4 weeks (buffer sharing logic, multi-frontier cleanup,
column superset management).

**Prior Art.** Kafka's shared topics with consumer groups;
Materialize's shared arrangements; Flink's shared source state.

## Competitive Positioning

These features, if implemented, would give pg_trickle significant advantages
over every competing system:

| Feature | pg_trickle (proposed) | Feldera | Epsio | pg_ivm |
|---------|----------------------|---------|-------|--------|
| Algebraic aggregate maint. | ✅ (B-1) | ✅ (native) | Partial | ❌ |
| Predicate pushdown in delta | ✅ (B-2) | ✅ (native) | Unknown | ❌ |
| Cost-based strategy | ✅ (B-4) | N/A (streaming) | N/A | ❌ |
| Partitioned targets | ✅ (A-1) | N/A | ❌ | ❌ |
| Column-scoped delta | ✅ (A-2) | Partial | ❌ | ❌ |
| Change buffer compaction | ✅ (C-4) | ✅ (native) | Unknown | N/A |
| Tiered scheduling | ✅ (C-1) | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| UNLOGGED buffers | ✅ (D-1) | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Shared change buffers | ✅ (D-4) | ✅ (native) | Unknown | N/A |
| Custom WAL decoder | ✅ (D-2) | N/A | ✅ | ❌ |

The combination of **embedded PostgreSQL architecture** (zero external
dependencies) + **comprehensive SQL coverage** (39+ aggregates, full window
functions) + **these optimizations** would make pg_trickle the most capable
IVM system available for PostgreSQL.

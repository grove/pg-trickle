# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### What is pg_trickle?

pg_trickle is a PostgreSQL 18 extension that implements **stream tables** — declarative, automatically-refreshing materialized views with **Differential View Maintenance (DVM)**. You define a SQL query and a refresh schedule; the extension handles change capture, delta computation, and incremental refresh automatically.

It is inspired by the [DBSP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16684) differential dataflow framework. See [DBSP_COMPARISON.md](research/DBSP_COMPARISON.md) for a detailed comparison.

### How is this different from PostgreSQL materialized views?

| Feature | Materialized Views | Stream Tables |
|---|---|---|
| Refresh | Manual (`REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW`) | Automatic (scheduler) or manual |
| Incremental refresh | Not supported natively | Built-in differential mode |
| Change detection | None — always full recompute | CDC triggers track row-level changes |
| Dependency ordering | None | DAG-aware topological refresh |
| Monitoring | None | Built-in views, stats, NOTIFY alerts |
| Schedule | None | Duration strings (`5m`) or cron (`*/5 * * * *`) |

### What PostgreSQL versions are supported?

**PostgreSQL 18.x** exclusively. The extension uses features specific to PostgreSQL 18.

### Does pg_trickle require `wal_level = logical`?

**No.** pg_trickle uses lightweight row-level triggers for change data capture, not logical replication. You do not need to set `wal_level = logical` or configure `max_replication_slots`.

### Is pg_trickle production-ready?

pg_trickle is under active development. It has a comprehensive test suite (700+ unit tests, 290+ end-to-end tests), but users should evaluate it against their specific workloads before deploying to production.

## Installation & Setup

### How do I install pg_trickle?

1. Add `pg_trickle` to `shared_preload_libraries` in `postgresql.conf`:
   ```ini
   shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_trickle'
   ```
2. Restart PostgreSQL.
3. Run:
   ```sql
   CREATE EXTENSION pg_trickle;
   ```

See [INSTALL.md](../INSTALL.md) for platform-specific instructions and pre-built release artifacts.

### What are the minimum configuration requirements?

Only `shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_trickle'` is mandatory (requires a restart). All other settings have sensible defaults. `max_worker_processes = 8` is recommended.

### Can I install pg_trickle on a managed PostgreSQL service (RDS, Cloud SQL, etc.)?

It depends on whether the service allows custom extensions and `shared_preload_libraries`. Since pg_trickle does **not** require `wal_level = logical`, it avoids one of the most common restrictions on managed services. Check your provider's documentation for custom extension support.

### How do I uninstall pg_trickle?

1. Drop all stream tables first (or they will be cascade-dropped):
   ```sql
   SELECT pgtrickle.drop_stream_table(pgt_name) FROM pgtrickle.pgt_stream_tables;
   ```
2. Drop the extension:
   ```sql
   DROP EXTENSION pg_trickle CASCADE;
   ```
3. Remove `pg_trickle` from `shared_preload_libraries` and restart PostgreSQL.

## Creating & Managing Stream Tables

### How do I create a stream table?

```sql
SELECT pgtrickle.create_stream_table(
    'order_totals',                                           -- name
    'SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total
     FROM orders GROUP BY customer_id',                       -- defining query
    '5m',                                                     -- refresh schedule
    'DIFFERENTIAL'                                            -- refresh mode
);
```

### What is the difference between FULL and DIFFERENTIAL refresh mode?

- **FULL** — Truncates the stream table and re-runs the entire defining query every refresh cycle. Simple but expensive for large result sets.
- **DIFFERENTIAL** — Computes only the delta (changes since the last refresh) using the DVM engine and applies it via a `MERGE` statement. Much faster when only a small fraction of source data changes between refreshes.
- **IMMEDIATE** — Maintains the stream table synchronously within the same transaction as the base table DML. Uses statement-level triggers with transition tables — no change buffers, no scheduler. The stream table is always up-to-date.

### When should I use FULL vs. DIFFERENTIAL vs. IMMEDIATE?

Use **DIFFERENTIAL** (default) when:
- Source tables are large and changes between refreshes are small
- The defining query uses supported operators (most common SQL is supported)
- Some staleness (seconds to minutes) is acceptable

Use **FULL** when:
- The defining query uses unsupported aggregates (`CORR`, `COVAR_*`, `REGR_*`)
- Source tables are small and a full recompute is cheap
- You see frequent adaptive fallbacks to FULL (check refresh history)

Use **IMMEDIATE** when:
- The stream table must always reflect the latest committed data
- You need transactional consistency (reads within the same transaction see updated data)
- Write-side overhead per DML statement is acceptable
- The defining query is relatively simple (no TopK, no materialized view sources)

### What are the advantages and disadvantages of IMMEDIATE vs. deferred (FULL/DIFFERENTIAL) refresh modes?

**IMMEDIATE mode**

| | Detail |
|---|---|
| ✅ Read-your-writes consistency | The stream table is updated within the same transaction as the base table DML — always current from the writer's perspective. |
| ✅ No lag | No background worker, no schedule interval. The view is never stale. |
| ✅ No change buffers | `pgtrickle_changes.*` tables are not used, reducing write overhead on source tables. |
| ✅ pg_ivm compatibility | Drop-in migration path for existing pg_ivm / IMMV users. |
| ❌ Write amplification | Every DML statement on a base table also executes IVM trigger logic, adding latency to the original transaction. |
| ❌ Serialized concurrent writes | An `ExclusiveLock` is taken on the stream table during maintenance, serializing writers. |
| ❌ Limited SQL support | Window functions, recursive CTEs, `LATERAL` joins, scalar subqueries, and TopK (`ORDER BY … LIMIT`) are not supported — use `DIFFERENTIAL` instead. |
| ❌ No cascading | IMMEDIATE stream tables that depend on other IMMEDIATE stream tables are not supported. |
| ❌ No throttling | The refresh cannot be delayed or rate-limited. |

**Deferred mode (`FULL` / `DIFFERENTIAL`)**

| | Detail |
|---|---|
| ✅ Decoupled write path | Base table writes are fast; view maintenance runs later via the scheduler or manual refresh. |
| ✅ Broadest SQL support | Window functions, recursive CTEs, `LATERAL`, `UNION`, user-defined aggregates, TopK, cascading stream tables, and more. |
| ✅ Adaptive cost control | `DIFFERENTIAL` automatically falls back to `FULL` when the change ratio exceeds `pg_trickle.differential_max_change_ratio`. |
| ✅ Concurrency-friendly | Writers never block on view maintenance. |
| ❌ Staleness | The stream table lags by up to one schedule interval (e.g. `1m`). |
| ❌ No read-your-writes | A writer querying the stream table immediately after a write may see the pre-change data. |
| ❌ Infrastructure overhead | Requires change buffer tables, a background worker, and frontier tracking. |

**Rule of thumb:** use `IMMEDIATE` when the query is simple and freshness within the transaction matters. Use `DIFFERENTIAL` (or `FULL`) for complex queries, high concurrency, or when you want to decouple write latency from view maintenance.

### What schedule formats are supported?

**Duration strings:**

| Unit | Suffix | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Seconds | `s` | `30s` |
| Minutes | `m` | `5m` |
| Hours | `h` | `2h` |
| Days | `d` | `1d` |
| Weeks | `w` | `1w` |
| Compound | — | `1h30m` |

**Cron expressions:**

| Format | Example | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 5-field | `*/5 * * * *` | Every 5 minutes |
| Aliases | `@hourly`, `@daily` | Built-in shortcuts |

**CALCULATED mode:** Pass `NULL` as the schedule to inherit the schedule from downstream dependents.

### What is the minimum allowed schedule?

The `pg_trickle.min_schedule_seconds` GUC (default: `60`) sets the floor. Schedules shorter than this value are rejected. Set to `1` for development/testing.

### Can a stream table reference another stream table?

**Yes.** Stream tables can depend on other stream tables. The scheduler automatically refreshes them in topological order (upstream first). Circular dependencies are detected and rejected at creation time.

```sql
-- ST1: aggregates orders
SELECT pgtrickle.create_stream_table('order_totals',
    'SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total FROM orders GROUP BY customer_id',
    '1m', 'DIFFERENTIAL');

-- ST2: filters ST1
SELECT pgtrickle.create_stream_table('big_customers',
    'SELECT customer_id, total FROM pgtrickle.order_totals WHERE total > 1000',
    '1m', 'DIFFERENTIAL');
```

### How do I change a stream table's schedule or mode?

```sql
-- Change schedule
SELECT pgtrickle.alter_stream_table('order_totals', schedule => '10m');

-- Switch refresh mode
SELECT pgtrickle.alter_stream_table('order_totals', refresh_mode => 'FULL');

-- Suspend
SELECT pgtrickle.alter_stream_table('order_totals', status => 'SUSPENDED');

-- Resume
SELECT pgtrickle.alter_stream_table('order_totals', status => 'ACTIVE');
```

### Can I change the defining query of a stream table?

Not directly. You must drop and recreate the stream table:

```sql
SELECT pgtrickle.drop_stream_table('order_totals');
SELECT pgtrickle.create_stream_table('order_totals', '<new query>', '5m', 'DIFFERENTIAL');
```

### How do I trigger a manual refresh?

```sql
SELECT pgtrickle.refresh_stream_table('order_totals');
```

This works even when `pg_trickle.enabled = false` (scheduler disabled).

---

## SQL Support

### What SQL features are supported in defining queries?

Most common SQL is supported in both FULL and DIFFERENTIAL modes:

- Table scans, projections, `WHERE`/`HAVING` filters
- `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `FULL OUTER JOIN` (including multi-table joins)
- `GROUP BY` with 25+ aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `BOOL_AND`/`OR`, `STRING_AGG`, `ARRAY_AGG`, `JSON_AGG`, `JSONB_AGG`, `BIT_AND`/`OR`/`XOR`, `STDDEV`, `VARIANCE`, `MODE`, `PERCENTILE_CONT`/`DISC`, and more)
- `FILTER (WHERE ...)` on aggregates
- `DISTINCT`
- Set operations: `UNION ALL`, `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, `INTERSECT ALL`, `EXCEPT`, `EXCEPT ALL`
- Subqueries: `EXISTS`, `NOT EXISTS`, `IN (subquery)`, `NOT IN (subquery)`, scalar subqueries
- Non-recursive and recursive CTEs
- Window functions (`ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, `SUM OVER`, etc.)
- `LATERAL` joins with set-returning functions and correlated subqueries
- `CASE`, `COALESCE`, `NULLIF`, `GREATEST`, `LEAST`, `BETWEEN`, `IS DISTINCT FROM`

See [DVM Operators](DVM_OPERATORS.md) for the complete list.

### What SQL features are NOT supported?

The following are rejected with clear error messages and suggested rewrites:

| Feature | Reason | Suggested Rewrite |
|---|---|---|
| `TABLESAMPLE` | Stream tables materialize the full result set | Use `WHERE random() < fraction` in consuming query |
| Window functions in expressions | Cannot be differentially maintained | Move window function to a separate column |
| `LIMIT` / `OFFSET` | Stream tables materialize the full result set | Apply when querying the stream table |
| `FOR UPDATE` / `FOR SHARE` | Row-level locking not applicable | Remove the locking clause |

The following were previously rejected but are **now supported** via automatic parse-time rewrites:

| Feature | How It Works |
|---|---|
| `DISTINCT ON (…)` | Auto-rewritten to `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY ... ORDER BY ...) = 1` subquery |
| `GROUPING SETS` / `CUBE` / `ROLLUP` | Auto-rewritten to `UNION ALL` of separate `GROUP BY` queries |
| `NATURAL JOIN` | Common columns resolved at parse time; explicit equi-join synthesized |
| `ALL (subquery)` | Rewritten to `NOT EXISTS` with negated condition (AntiJoin) |

Each rejected feature is explained in detail in the [Why Are These SQL Features Not Supported?](#why-are-these-sql-features-not-supported) section below.

### What happens to `ORDER BY` in defining queries?

`ORDER BY` is **accepted but silently discarded**. Row order in a stream table is undefined (consistent with PostgreSQL's `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` behavior). Apply `ORDER BY` when **querying** the stream table, not in the defining query.

### Which aggregates support DIFFERENTIAL mode?

**Algebraic** (O(changes), fully incremental): `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`

**Semi-algebraic** (incremental with occasional group rescan): `MIN`, `MAX`

**Group-rescan** (affected groups re-aggregated from source): `STRING_AGG`, `ARRAY_AGG`, `JSON_AGG`, `JSONB_AGG`, `BOOL_AND`, `BOOL_OR`, `BIT_AND`, `BIT_OR`, `BIT_XOR`, `JSON_OBJECT_AGG`, `JSONB_OBJECT_AGG`, `STDDEV`, `STDDEV_POP`, `STDDEV_SAMP`, `VARIANCE`, `VAR_POP`, `VAR_SAMP`, `MODE`, `PERCENTILE_CONT`, `PERCENTILE_DISC`, `CORR`, `COVAR_POP`, `COVAR_SAMP`, `REGR_AVGX`, `REGR_AVGY`, `REGR_COUNT`, `REGR_INTERCEPT`, `REGR_R2`, `REGR_SLOPE`, `REGR_SXX`, `REGR_SXY`, `REGR_SYY`

**37 aggregate function variants** are supported in total.

## Change Data Capture (CDC)

### How does pg_trickle capture changes to source tables?

pg_trickle installs `AFTER INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE` row-level PL/pgSQL triggers on each source table. These triggers write change records (action, old/new row data as JSONB, LSN, transaction ID) into per-source buffer tables in the `pgtrickle_changes` schema.

### What is the overhead of CDC triggers?

Approximately **20–55 μs per row** (PL/pgSQL dispatch + `row_to_json()` + buffer INSERT). At typical write rates (<1000 writes/sec per source table), this adds **less than 5%** DML latency overhead.

### What happens when I `TRUNCATE` a source table?

**TRUNCATE is now captured** via a statement-level `AFTER TRUNCATE` trigger that writes a `T` marker row to the change buffer. When the differential refresh engine detects this marker, it automatically falls back to a full refresh for that cycle, ensuring the stream table stays consistent.

Previously, TRUNCATE bypassed row-level triggers entirely. This is no longer a concern — both FULL and DIFFERENTIAL mode stream tables handle TRUNCATE correctly.

### Are CDC triggers automatically cleaned up?

Yes. When the last stream table referencing a source is dropped, the trigger and its associated change buffer table are automatically removed.

### What happens if a source table is dropped or altered?

pg_trickle has DDL event triggers that detect `ALTER TABLE` and `DROP TABLE` on source tables. When detected:
- Affected stream tables are marked with `needs_reinit = true`
- The next refresh cycle performs a full reinitialization (drops and recreates the storage table)
- A `reinitialize_needed` NOTIFY alert is sent

### How do I check if a source table has switched from trigger-based CDC to WAL-based CDC?

When you enable hybrid CDC (`pg_trickle.cdc_mode = 'auto'`), pg_trickle starts capturing changes with triggers and can automatically transition to WAL-based logical replication once conditions are met. There are several ways to check the current CDC mode for each source table:

**1. Query the dependency catalog directly:**

```sql
SELECT d.source_relid, c.relname AS source_table, d.cdc_mode,
       d.slot_name, d.decoder_confirmed_lsn, d.transition_started_at
FROM pgtrickle.pgt_dependencies d
JOIN pg_class c ON c.oid = d.source_relid;
```

The `cdc_mode` column shows one of three values:
- `TRIGGER` — changes are captured via row-level triggers (the default)
- `TRANSITIONING` — the system is in the process of switching from triggers to WAL
- `WAL` — changes are captured via logical replication

**2. Use the built-in health check function:**

```sql
SELECT source_table, cdc_mode, slot_name, lag_bytes, alert
FROM pgtrickle.check_cdc_health();
```

This returns a row per source table with the current mode, replication slot lag (for WAL-mode sources), and any alert conditions such as `slot_lag_exceeds_threshold` or `replication_slot_missing`.

**3. Listen for real-time transition notifications:**

```sql
LISTEN pg_trickle_cdc_transition;
```

pg_trickle sends a `NOTIFY` with a JSON payload whenever a transition starts, completes, or is rolled back. Example payload:

```json
{
  "event": "transition_complete",
  "source_table": "public.orders",
  "old_mode": "TRANSITIONING",
  "new_mode": "WAL",
  "slot_name": "pg_trickle_slot_16384"
}
```

This lets you integrate CDC mode changes into your monitoring stack without polling.

**4. Check the global GUC setting:**

```sql
SHOW pg_trickle.cdc_mode;
```

This shows the *desired* global behavior (`trigger`, `auto`, or `wal`), not the per-table actual state. The per-table state lives in `pgt_dependencies.cdc_mode` as described above.

See [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md) for details on the `pg_trickle.cdc_mode` and `pg_trickle.wal_transition_timeout` GUCs.

### Is it safe to add triggers to a stream table while the source table is switching CDC modes?

**Yes, this is completely safe.** CDC mode transitions and user-defined triggers operate on different tables and do not interfere with each other:

- **CDC transitions** affect how changes are captured from **source tables** (e.g., `orders`). The transition switches the capture mechanism from row-level triggers on the source table to WAL-based logical replication.
- **User-defined triggers** live on **stream tables** (e.g., `order_totals`) and control how the refresh engine *applies* changes to the materialized output.

Because these are independent concerns, you can freely add, modify, or remove triggers on a stream table at any point — including during an active CDC transition on its source tables.

**How it works in practice:**

1. The refresh engine checks for user-defined triggers on the stream table at the start of each refresh cycle (via a fast `pg_trigger` lookup, <0.1 ms).
2. If user triggers are detected, the engine uses explicit `DELETE` / `UPDATE` / `INSERT` statements instead of `MERGE`, so your triggers fire with correct `TG_OP`, `OLD`, and `NEW` values.
3. The change data consumed by the refresh engine has the same format regardless of whether it came from CDC triggers or WAL decoding — so the trigger detection and the CDC mode are fully decoupled.

A trigger added between two refresh cycles will simply be picked up on the next cycle. The only (theoretical) edge case is adding a trigger in the tiny window *during* a single refresh transaction, between the trigger-detection check and the MERGE execution — but since both happen within the same transaction, this is virtually impossible in practice.

## Performance & Tuning

### How do I tune the scheduler interval?

The `pg_trickle.scheduler_interval_ms` GUC controls how often the scheduler checks for stale stream tables (default: 1000 ms).

| Workload | Recommended Value |
|---|---|
| Low-latency (near real-time) | `100`–`500` |
| Standard | `1000` (default) |
| Low-overhead (many STs, long schedules) | `5000`–`10000` |

### What is the adaptive fallback to FULL?

When the number of pending changes exceeds `pg_trickle.differential_max_change_ratio` (default: 15%) of the source table size, DIFFERENTIAL mode automatically falls back to FULL for that refresh cycle. This prevents pathological delta queries on bulk changes.

- Set to `0.0` to always use DIFFERENTIAL (even on large change sets)
- Set to `1.0` to effectively always use FULL
- Default `0.15` (15%) is a good balance

### How many concurrent refreshes can run?

Controlled by `pg_trickle.max_concurrent_refreshes` (default: 4, range: 1–32). Each concurrent refresh uses a background worker. Increase this if you have many stream tables and available CPU/IO.

### How do I check if my stream tables are keeping up?

```sql
-- Quick overview
SELECT pgt_name, status, staleness, stale
FROM pgtrickle.stream_tables_info;

-- Detailed statistics
SELECT pgt_name, total_refreshes, avg_duration_ms, consecutive_errors, stale
FROM pgtrickle.pg_stat_stream_tables;

-- Recent refresh history for a specific ST
SELECT * FROM pgtrickle.get_refresh_history('order_totals', 10);
```

### What is `__pgt_row_id`?

Every stream table has a `__pgt_row_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY` column. It stores a 64-bit xxHash of the row's group-by key (or all columns for non-aggregate queries). The refresh engine uses it for delta `MERGE` operations (matching DELETEs and INSERTs by row ID).

**You should ignore this column in your queries.** It is an implementation detail.

---

## Interoperability

### Can PostgreSQL views reference stream tables?

**Yes.** Stream tables are standard heap tables. Views work normally and reflect data as of the most recent refresh.

### Can materialized views reference stream tables?

**Yes**, though it is somewhat redundant (both are physical snapshots). The materialized view requires its own `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` — it does not auto-refresh when the stream table refreshes.

### Can I replicate stream tables with logical replication?

**Yes.** Stream tables can be published like any ordinary table:

```sql
CREATE PUBLICATION my_pub FOR TABLE pgtrickle.order_totals;
```

**Important caveats:**
- The `__pgt_row_id` column is replicated (it is the primary key)
- Subscribers receive materialized data, not the defining query
- Do **not** install pg_trickle on the subscriber and attempt to refresh the replicated table — it will have no CDC triggers or catalog entries
- Internal change buffer tables are not published by default

### Can I `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` rows in a stream table directly?

**No.** Stream table contents are managed exclusively by the refresh engine. Direct DML will corrupt the internal state.

### Can I add foreign keys to or from stream tables?

**No.** The refresh engine uses bulk `MERGE` operations that do not respect foreign key ordering. Foreign key constraints on stream tables are not supported.

### Can I add my own triggers to stream tables?

**Yes, for DIFFERENTIAL mode stream tables.** When user-defined row-level triggers are detected (or `pg_trickle.user_triggers = 'on'`), the refresh engine automatically switches from `MERGE` to explicit `DELETE` + `UPDATE` + `INSERT` statements. This ensures triggers fire with the correct `TG_OP`, `OLD`, and `NEW` values.

**Limitations:**
- Row-level triggers do **not** fire during FULL refresh (they are automatically suppressed via `DISABLE TRIGGER USER`). Use `REFRESH MODE DIFFERENTIAL` for stream tables with triggers.
- The `IS DISTINCT FROM` guard prevents no-op `UPDATE` triggers when the aggregate result is unchanged.
- `BEFORE` triggers that modify `NEW` will affect the stored value — the next refresh may "correct" it back, causing oscillation.

See the `pg_trickle.user_triggers` GUC in [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md) for control options.

### Can I `ALTER TABLE` a stream table directly?

**No.** Use `pgtrickle.alter_stream_table()` to modify schedule, refresh mode, or status. To change the defining query, drop and recreate the stream table.

### Does pg_trickle work with PgBouncer or other connection poolers?

**It depends on the pooling mode.** pg_trickle's background scheduler uses session-level features that are incompatible with **transaction-mode** connection pooling:

| Feature | Issue with Transaction-Mode Pooling |
|---|---|
| `pg_advisory_lock()` | Session-level lock released when connection returns to pool — concurrent refreshes possible |
| `PREPARE` / `EXECUTE` | Prepared statements are session-scoped — "does not exist" errors on different connections |
| `LISTEN` / `NOTIFY` | Notifications lost when listeners change connections |

**Recommended configurations:**

- **Session-mode pooling** (`pool_mode = session`): Fully compatible. The scheduler holds a dedicated connection.
- **Direct connection** (no pooler for the scheduler): Fully compatible. Application queries can still go through a pooler.
- **Transaction-mode pooling** (`pool_mode = transaction`): **Not supported.** The scheduler requires a persistent session.

**Tip:** If your infrastructure requires transaction-mode pooling (e.g., AWS RDS Proxy, Supabase), route the pg_trickle background worker through a direct connection while keeping application traffic on the pooler. Most connection poolers support per-database or per-user routing rules.

## Monitoring & Alerting

### What monitoring views are available?

| View | Description |
|---|---|
| `pgtrickle.stream_tables_info` | Status overview with computed staleness |
| `pgtrickle.pg_stat_stream_tables` | Comprehensive stats (refresh counts, avg duration, error streaks) |

### How do I get alerted when something goes wrong?

pg_trickle sends PostgreSQL `NOTIFY` messages on the `pg_trickle_alert` channel with JSON payloads:

| Event | When |
|---|---|
| `stale_data` | Staleness exceeds 2× the schedule |
| `auto_suspended` | Stream table suspended after max consecutive errors |
| `reinitialize_needed` | Upstream DDL change detected |
| `buffer_growth_warning` | Change buffer growing unexpectedly |
| `refresh_completed` | Refresh completed successfully |
| `refresh_failed` | Refresh failed |

Listen with:
```sql
LISTEN pg_trickle_alert;
```

### What happens when a stream table keeps failing?

After `pg_trickle.max_consecutive_errors` (default: 3) consecutive failures, the stream table moves to `ERROR` status and automatic refreshes stop. An `auto_suspended` NOTIFY alert is sent.

To recover:
```sql
-- Fix the underlying issue (e.g., restore a dropped source table), then:
SELECT pgtrickle.alter_stream_table('my_table', status => 'ACTIVE');
```

Retries use exponential backoff (base 1s, max 60s, ±25% jitter, up to 5 retries before counting as a real failure).

## Configuration Reference

| GUC | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pg_trickle.enabled` | bool | `true` | Enable/disable the scheduler. Manual refreshes still work when `false`. |
| `pg_trickle.scheduler_interval_ms` | int | `1000` | Scheduler wake interval in milliseconds (100–60000) |
| `pg_trickle.min_schedule_seconds` | int | `60` | Minimum allowed schedule duration (1–86400) |
| `pg_trickle.max_consecutive_errors` | int | `3` | Failures before auto-suspending (1–100) |
| `pg_trickle.change_buffer_schema` | text | `pgtrickle_changes` | Schema for CDC buffer tables |
| `pg_trickle.max_concurrent_refreshes` | int | `4` | Max parallel refresh workers (1–32) |
| `pg_trickle.user_triggers` | text | `auto` | User trigger handling: `auto` (detect), `on` (always explicit DML), `off` (suppress) |
| `pg_trickle.differential_max_change_ratio` | float | `0.15` | Change ratio threshold for adaptive FULL fallback (0.0–1.0) |
| `pg_trickle.cleanup_use_truncate` | bool | `true` | Use TRUNCATE instead of DELETE for buffer cleanup |

All GUCs are `SUSET` context (superuser SET) and take effect without restart, except `shared_preload_libraries` which requires a PostgreSQL restart.

## Troubleshooting

### Unit tests crash with `symbol not found in flat namespace` on macOS 26+

macOS 26 (Tahoe) changed the dynamic linker (`dyld`) to eagerly resolve all
flat-namespace symbols at binary load time. pgrx extensions link PostgreSQL
server symbols (e.g. `CacheMemoryContext`, `SPI_connect`) with
`-Wl,-undefined,dynamic_lookup`, which previously resolved lazily. Since
`cargo test --lib` runs outside the postgres process, those symbols are
missing and the test binary aborts:

```
dyld[66617]: symbol not found in flat namespace '_CacheMemoryContext'
```

**Use `just test-unit`** — it automatically detects macOS 26+ and injects a
stub library (`libpg_stub.dylib`) via `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`. The stub
provides NULL/no-op definitions for the ~28 PostgreSQL symbols; they are never
called during unit tests (pure Rust logic only).

This does **not** affect integration tests, E2E tests, `just lint`,
`just build`, or the extension running inside PostgreSQL.

See the [Installation Guide](../INSTALL.md#unit-tests-crash-on-macos-26-symbol-not-found-in-flat-namespace) for details and manual usage.

### My stream table is stuck in INITIALIZING status

The initial full refresh may have failed. Check:
```sql
SELECT * FROM pgtrickle.get_refresh_history('my_table', 5);
```
If the error is transient, retry with:
```sql
SELECT pgtrickle.refresh_stream_table('my_table');
```

### My stream table shows stale data but the scheduler is running

Common causes:
1. **TRUNCATE on source table** — bypasses CDC triggers. Manual refresh needed.
2. **Too many errors** — check `consecutive_errors` in `pgtrickle.pg_stat_stream_tables`. Resume with `ALTER ... status => 'ACTIVE'`.
3. **Long-running refresh** — check for lock contention or slow defining queries.
4. **Scheduler disabled** — verify `SHOW pg_trickle.enabled;` returns `on`.

### I get "cycle detected" when creating a stream table

Stream tables cannot have circular dependencies. If ST-A depends on ST-B and ST-B depends on ST-A (directly or transitively), creation is rejected. Restructure your queries to break the cycle.

### A source table was altered and my stream table stopped refreshing

pg_trickle detects DDL changes via event triggers and marks affected stream tables with `needs_reinit = true`. The next scheduler cycle will reinitialize (full drop + recreate of storage) the stream table automatically. If the schema change breaks the defining query, the reinitialization will fail — check refresh history for the error and recreate the stream table with an updated query.

### How do I see the delta query generated for a stream table?

```sql
SELECT pgtrickle.explain_st('order_totals');
```

This shows the DVM operator tree, source tables, and the generated delta SQL.

## Why Are These SQL Features Not Supported?

This section gives detailed technical explanations for each SQL limitation. pg_trickle follows the principle of **"fail loudly rather than produce wrong data"** — every unsupported feature is detected at stream-table creation time and rejected with a clear error message and a suggested rewrite.

### How does `NATURAL JOIN` work?

`NATURAL JOIN` is **now fully supported**. At parse time, pg_trickle resolves the common columns between the two tables (using `OpTree::output_columns()`) and synthesizes explicit equi-join conditions. This supports `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, and `FULL` NATURAL JOIN variants.

Internally, `NATURAL JOIN` is converted to an explicit `JOIN ... ON` before the DVM engine builds its operator tree, so delta computation works identically to a manually specified equi-join.

**Note:** The internal `__pgt_row_id` column is excluded from common column resolution, so NATURAL JOINs between stream tables work correctly.

### How do `GROUPING SETS`, `CUBE`, and `ROLLUP` work?

`GROUPING SETS`, `CUBE`, and `ROLLUP` are **now fully supported** via an automatic parse-time rewrite. pg_trickle decomposes these constructs into a `UNION ALL` of separate `GROUP BY` queries before the DVM engine processes the query.

> **Explosion guard:** `CUBE(N)` generates $2^N$ branches. pg_trickle rejects
> CUBE/ROLLUP combinations that would produce more than **64 branches** to
> prevent runaway memory usage. Use explicit `GROUPING SETS(...)` instead.

For example:
```sql
-- This defining query:
SELECT dept, region, SUM(amount) FROM sales GROUP BY CUBE(dept, region)

-- Is automatically rewritten to:
SELECT dept, region, SUM(amount) FROM sales GROUP BY dept, region
UNION ALL
SELECT dept, NULL::text, SUM(amount) FROM sales GROUP BY dept
UNION ALL
SELECT NULL::text, region, SUM(amount) FROM sales GROUP BY region
UNION ALL
SELECT NULL::text, NULL::text, SUM(amount) FROM sales
```

`GROUPING()` function calls are replaced with integer literal constants corresponding to the grouping level. The rewrite is transparent — the DVM engine sees only standard `GROUP BY` + `UNION ALL` operators and can apply incremental delta computation to each branch independently.

### How does `DISTINCT ON (…)` work?

`DISTINCT ON` is **now fully supported** via an automatic parse-time rewrite. pg_trickle transparently transforms `DISTINCT ON` into a `ROW_NUMBER()` window function subquery:

```sql
-- This defining query:
SELECT DISTINCT ON (dept) dept, employee, salary
FROM employees ORDER BY dept, salary DESC

-- Is automatically rewritten to:
SELECT dept, employee, salary FROM (
    SELECT dept, employee, salary,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY dept ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rn
    FROM employees
) sub WHERE rn = 1
```

The rewrite happens before DVM parsing, so the operator tree sees a standard window function query and can apply partition-based recomputation for incremental delta maintenance.

### Why is `TABLESAMPLE` rejected?

`TABLESAMPLE` returns a random subset of rows from a table (e.g., `FROM orders TABLESAMPLE BERNOULLI(10)` gives ~10% of rows).

Stream tables materialize the **complete** result set of the defining query and keep it up-to-date across refreshes. Baking a random sample into the defining query is not meaningful because:

1. **Non-determinism.** Each refresh would sample different rows, making the stream table contents unstable and unpredictable. The delta between refreshes would be dominated by sampling noise, not actual data changes.

2. **CDC incompatibility.** The trigger-based change-capture system tracks specific row-level changes (inserts, updates, deletes). A `TABLESAMPLE` defining query has no stable row identity — the "changed rows" concept doesn't apply when the entire sample shifts each cycle.

**Rewrite:**
```sql
-- Instead of sampling in the defining query:
SELECT * FROM orders TABLESAMPLE BERNOULLI(10)

-- Materialize the full result and sample when querying:
SELECT * FROM order_stream_table WHERE random() < 0.1
```

### Why is `LIMIT` / `OFFSET` rejected?

Stream tables materialize the complete result set and keep it synchronized with source data. Bare `LIMIT`/`OFFSET` (without a recognized pattern) would truncate the result:

1. **Undefined ordering.** `LIMIT` without `ORDER BY` returns an arbitrary subset.

2. **Delta instability.** When source rows change, the boundary between "in the LIMIT" and "out of the LIMIT" shifts. A single INSERT could evict one row and admit another, requiring the refresh to track the full ordered position of every row.

3. **Semantic mismatch.** Users who write `LIMIT 100` typically want to limit what they *read*, not what is *stored*.

**Exception — TopK pattern:** When the defining query has a top-level `ORDER BY … LIMIT N` (constant integer, no OFFSET), pg_trickle recognizes this as a "TopK" query and accepts it. The stream table stores only the top-N rows and is refreshed via a MERGE-based scoped-recomputation strategy. See the SQL Reference for details.

**Rewrite (when TopK doesn't apply):**
```sql
-- Instead of:
'SELECT * FROM orders ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 100'

-- Omit LIMIT from the defining query, apply when reading:
SELECT * FROM orders_stream_table ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 100
```

### Why are window functions in expressions rejected?

Window functions like `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (…)` are supported as **standalone columns** in stream tables. However, embedding a window function inside an expression — such as `CASE WHEN ROW_NUMBER() OVER (...) = 1 THEN ...` or `SUM(x) OVER (...) + 1` — is rejected.

This restriction exists because:

1. **Partition-based recomputation.** pg_trickle's differential mode handles window functions by recomputing entire partitions that were affected by changes. When a window function is buried inside an expression, the DVM engine cannot isolate the window computation from the surrounding expression, making it impossible to correctly identify which partitions to recompute.

2. **Expression tree ambiguity.** The DVM parser would need to differentiate the outer expression (arithmetic, `CASE`, etc.) while treating the inner window function specially. This creates a combinatorial explosion of differentiation rules for every possible expression type × window function combination.

**Rewrite:**
```sql
-- Instead of:
SELECT id, CASE WHEN ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY dept ORDER BY salary DESC) = 1
                THEN 'top' ELSE 'other' END AS rank_label
FROM employees

-- Move window function to a separate column, then use a wrapping stream table:
-- ST1:
SELECT id, dept, salary,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY dept ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rn
FROM employees

-- ST2 (references ST1):
SELECT id, CASE WHEN rn = 1 THEN 'top' ELSE 'other' END AS rank_label
FROM pgtrickle.employees_ranked
```

### Why is `FOR UPDATE` / `FOR SHARE` rejected?

`FOR UPDATE` and related locking clauses (`FOR SHARE`, `FOR NO KEY UPDATE`, `FOR KEY SHARE`) acquire row-level locks on selected rows. This is incompatible with stream tables because:

1. **Refresh semantics.** Stream table contents are managed by the refresh engine using bulk `MERGE` operations. Row-level locks taken during the defining query would conflict with the refresh engine's own locking strategy.

2. **No direct DML.** Since users cannot directly modify stream table rows, there is no use case for locking rows inside the defining query. The locks would be held for the duration of the refresh transaction and then released, serving no purpose.

### Why is `ALL (subquery)` not supported?

`ALL (subquery)` compares a value against every row returned by a subquery (e.g., `WHERE x > ALL (SELECT y FROM t)`). It is rejected because:

1. **Negation rewrite complexity.** `x > ALL (SELECT y FROM t)` is logically equivalent to `NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM t WHERE y >= x)`, which pg_trickle can handle via its anti-join operator. The rewrite is straightforward.

2. **Rare usage.** `ALL (subquery)` is uncommon in analytical queries. Supporting it directly would add operator complexity for minimal benefit.

**Rewrite:**
```sql
-- Instead of:
WHERE amount > ALL (SELECT threshold FROM limits)

-- Use NOT EXISTS:
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM limits WHERE threshold >= amount)
```

### Why is `ORDER BY` silently discarded?

`ORDER BY` in the defining query is **accepted but ignored**. This is consistent with how PostgreSQL treats `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW AS SELECT ... ORDER BY ...` — the ordering is not preserved in the stored data.

Stream tables are heap tables with no guaranteed row order. The `ORDER BY` in the defining query would only affect the order of the initial `INSERT`, which has no lasting effect. Apply ordering when **querying** the stream table:

```sql
-- This ORDER BY is meaningless in the defining query:
'SELECT region, SUM(amount) FROM orders GROUP BY region ORDER BY total DESC'

-- Instead, order when reading:
SELECT * FROM regional_totals ORDER BY total DESC
```

### Why are unsupported aggregates (`CORR`, `COVAR_*`, `REGR_*`) limited to FULL mode?

Regression aggregates like `CORR`, `COVAR_POP`, `COVAR_SAMP`, and the `REGR_*` family require maintaining running sums of products and squares across the entire group. Unlike `COUNT`/`SUM`/`AVG` (where deltas can be computed from the change alone) or group-rescan aggregates (where only affected groups are re-read), regression aggregates:

1. **Lack algebraic delta rules.** There is no closed-form way to update a correlation coefficient from a single row change without access to the full group's data.

2. **Would degrade to group-rescan anyway.** Even if supported, the implementation would need to rescan the full group from source — identical to FULL mode for most practical group sizes.

These aggregates work fine in **FULL** refresh mode, which re-runs the entire query from scratch each cycle.

## Why Are These Stream Table Operations Restricted?

Stream tables are regular PostgreSQL heap tables under the hood, but their contents are managed exclusively by the refresh engine. This section explains why certain operations that work on ordinary tables are disallowed or unsupported on stream tables.

### Why can't I `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` rows in a stream table?

Stream table contents are the **output** of the refresh engine — they represent the materialized result of the defining query at a specific point in time. Direct DML would corrupt this contract in several ways:

1. **Row ID integrity.** Every row has a `__pgt_row_id` (a 64-bit xxHash of the group-by key or all columns). The refresh engine uses this for delta `MERGE` — matching incoming deltas against existing rows. A manually inserted row with an incorrect or duplicate `__pgt_row_id` would cause the next differential refresh to produce wrong results (double-counting, missed deletes, or merge conflicts).

2. **Frontier inconsistency.** Each refresh records a *frontier* — a set of per-source LSN positions that represent "data up to this point has been materialized." A manual DML change is not tracked by any frontier. The next differential refresh would either overwrite the change (if the delta touches the same row) or leave the stream table in a state that doesn't match any consistent point-in-time snapshot of the source data.

3. **Change buffer desync.** The CDC triggers on source tables write changes to buffer tables. The refresh engine reads these buffers and advances the frontier. Manual DML on the stream table bypasses this pipeline entirely — the buffer and frontier have no record of the change, so future refreshes cannot account for it.

If you need to post-process stream table data, create a **view** or a **second stream table** that references the first one.

### Why can't I add foreign keys to or from a stream table?

Foreign key constraints require that referenced/referencing rows exist at the time of each DML statement. The refresh engine violates this assumption:

1. **Bulk `MERGE` ordering.** A differential refresh executes a single `MERGE INTO` statement that applies all deltas (inserts and deletes) atomically. PostgreSQL evaluates FK constraints row-by-row within this `MERGE`. If a parent row is deleted and a new parent inserted in the same delta batch, the child FK check may fail because it sees the delete before the insert — even though the final state would be consistent.

2. **Full refresh uses `TRUNCATE` + `INSERT`.** In FULL mode, the refresh engine truncates the stream table and re-inserts all rows. `TRUNCATE` does not fire individual `DELETE` triggers and bypasses FK cascade logic, which would leave referencing tables with dangling references.

3. **Cross-table refresh ordering.** If stream table A has an FK referencing stream table B, both tables refresh independently (in topological order, but in separate transactions). There is no guarantee that A's refresh sees B's latest data — the FK constraint could transiently fail between refreshes.

**Workaround:** Enforce referential integrity in the consuming application or use a view that joins the stream tables and validates the relationship.

### How do user-defined triggers work on stream tables?

When a DIFFERENTIAL mode stream table has user-defined row-level triggers (or `pg_trickle.user_triggers = 'on'`), the refresh engine uses **explicit DML decomposition** instead of `MERGE`:

1. **Delta materialized once.** The delta query result is stored in a temporary table (`__pgt_delta_<id>`) to avoid evaluating it three times.

2. **DELETE removed rows.** Rows in the stream table whose `__pgt_row_id` is absent from the delta are deleted. `AFTER DELETE` triggers fire with correct `OLD` values.

3. **UPDATE changed rows.** Rows whose `__pgt_row_id` exists in both the stream table and delta but whose values differ (checked via `IS DISTINCT FROM`) are updated. `AFTER UPDATE` triggers fire with correct `OLD` and `NEW`. No-op updates (where values are identical) are skipped, preventing spurious triggers.

4. **INSERT new rows.** Rows in the delta whose `__pgt_row_id` is absent from the stream table are inserted. `AFTER INSERT` triggers fire with correct `NEW` values.

**FULL refresh behavior:** Row-level user triggers are automatically suppressed during FULL refresh via `DISABLE TRIGGER USER` / `ENABLE TRIGGER USER`. A `NOTIFY pgtrickle_refresh` is emitted so listeners know a FULL refresh occurred. Use `REFRESH MODE DIFFERENTIAL` for stream tables that need per-row trigger semantics.

**Performance:** The explicit DML path adds ~25–60% overhead compared to MERGE for triggered stream tables. Stream tables without user triggers have zero overhead (only a fast `pg_trigger` check, <0.1 ms).

**Control:** The `pg_trickle.user_triggers` GUC controls this behavior:
- `auto` (default): detect user triggers automatically
- `on`: always use explicit DML (useful for testing)
- `off`: always use MERGE, suppressing triggers

### Why can't I `ALTER TABLE` a stream table directly?

Stream table metadata (defining query, schedule, refresh mode) is stored in the pg_trickle catalog (`pgtrickle.pgt_stream_tables`). A direct `ALTER TABLE` would change the physical table without updating the catalog, causing:

1. **Column mismatch.** If you add or remove columns, the refresh engine's cached delta query and `MERGE` statement would reference columns that no longer exist (or miss new ones), causing runtime errors.

2. **`__pgt_row_id` invalidation.** The row ID hash is computed from the defining query's output columns. Altering the table schema without updating the defining query would make existing row IDs inconsistent with the new column set.

Use `pgtrickle.alter_stream_table()` to change schedule, refresh mode, or status. To change the defining query or column structure, drop and recreate the stream table.

### Why can't I `TRUNCATE` a stream table?

`TRUNCATE` removes all rows instantly but does not update the pg_trickle frontier or change buffers. After a `TRUNCATE`:

1. **Differential refresh sees no changes.** The frontier still records the last-processed LSN. No new source changes may have occurred, so the next differential refresh produces an empty delta — leaving the stream table empty even though the source still has data.

2. **No recovery path for differential mode.** The refresh engine has no way to detect that the stream table was externally truncated. It assumes the current contents match the frontier.

Use `pgtrickle.refresh_stream_table('my_table')` to force a full re-materialization, or drop and recreate the stream table if you need a clean slate.

### What are the memory limits for delta processing?

The differential refresh path executes the delta query as a **single SQL statement**. For large batches (e.g., a bulk UPDATE of 10M rows), PostgreSQL may attempt to materialize the entire delta result set in memory. If the delta exceeds `work_mem`, PostgreSQL will spill to temporary files on disk, which is slower but safe. In extreme cases, OOM (out of memory) can occur if `work_mem` is set very high and the delta is enormous.

**Mitigations:**

1. **Adaptive fallback.** The `pg_trickle.differential_max_change_ratio` GUC (default 0.15) automatically triggers a FULL refresh when the ratio of pending changes to total rows exceeds the threshold. This prevents large deltas from consuming excessive memory.

2. **`work_mem` tuning.** PostgreSQL's `work_mem` setting controls how much memory each sort/hash operation uses before spilling to disk. For pg_trickle workloads, 64–256 MB is typical. Monitor `temp_blks_written` in `pg_stat_statements` to detect spilling.

3. **`pg_trickle.merge_work_mem_mb` GUC.** Sets a session-level `work_mem` override during the MERGE execution (default: 0 = use global `work_mem`). This allows higher memory for refresh without affecting other queries.

4. **Monitoring.** If `pg_stat_statements` is installed, pg_trickle logs a warning when the MERGE query writes temporary blocks to disk.

### Why are refreshes processed sequentially?

The scheduler processes stream tables **sequentially** in topological (dependency) order within a single background worker process. Even though `pg_trickle.max_concurrent_refreshes` can be set up to 32, **parallel refresh of independent branches is not yet implemented**.

**Why sequential?**

- **Correctness.** Topological ordering guarantees that upstream stream tables are refreshed before downstream ones. Parallel execution of independent DAG branches requires careful lock management to avoid read/write conflicts.
- **Simplicity.** A single-worker model avoids connection pool exhaustion, advisory lock races, and prepared statement conflicts.

**Impact:**

- For most deployments with <100 stream tables, sequential processing adds negligible latency (each differential refresh typically takes 5–50ms).
- For large deployments with many independent stream tables, total cycle time = sum of all individual refresh times.

**Future:** Parallel refresh via multiple background workers is planned for a future release.

### How many connections does pg_trickle use?

pg_trickle uses the following PostgreSQL connections:

| Component | Connections | When |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| Background scheduler | 1 | Always (per database with STs) |
| WAL decoder polling | 0 (shared) | Uses the scheduler's SPI connection |
| Manual refresh | 1 | Per-call (uses caller's session) |

**Total**: 1 persistent connection per database. WAL decoder polling shares the scheduler's SPI connection rather than opening separate connections.

**`max_worker_processes`**: pg_trickle registers 1 background worker per database during `_PG_init()`. Ensure `max_worker_processes` (default 8) has room for the pg_trickle worker plus any other extensions.

**Advisory locks**: The scheduler holds a session-level advisory lock per actively-refreshing ST. These are released immediately after each refresh completes.

# Release Process

This document describes how to create a release of **pg_trickle**.

## Overview

Releases are fully automated via GitHub Actions. Pushing a version tag (`v*`)
triggers the [Release workflow](../.github/workflows/release.yml), which:

1. Builds extension packages for Linux (amd64), macOS (arm64), and Windows (amd64)
2. Smoke-tests the Linux artifact against a live PostgreSQL 18 instance
3. Creates a GitHub Release with archives and SHA256 checksums
4. Builds and pushes a multi-arch extension image to GHCR (for CNPG Image Volumes)

## Prerequisites

- Push access to the repository (or a PR merged by a maintainer)
- All CI checks passing on `main`
- The version in `Cargo.toml` matches the tag you intend to push
- Required GitHub secrets configured (see [Required GitHub Secrets](#required-github-secrets) below)

## Required GitHub Secrets

The release automation uses the following GitHub Actions secrets. Set them
under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**.

| Secret | Used by | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `PGXN_USERNAME` | `pgxn.yml` | Your PGXN account username. Required to authenticate the `pgxn upload` command when publishing source archives to the [PostgreSQL Extension Network](https://pgxn.org/). |
| `PGXN_PASSWORD` | `pgxn.yml` | Password for the PGXN account above. Never hardcode this — it must be stored as a secret so it is never exposed in logs or committed to the repository. |

> **Note:** The `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret is provided automatically by GitHub
> Actions and does not need to be configured manually. It is used by the
> release and Docker workflows to create GitHub Releases and push images to GHCR.

## Step-by-Step

### 1. Decide the version number

Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

| Change type                        | Bump    | Example         |
|------------------------------------|---------|-----------------|
| Breaking SQL API or config change  | Major   | `1.0.0 → 2.0.0` |
| New feature, backward-compatible   | Minor   | `0.1.0 → 0.2.0` |
| Bug fix, no API change             | Patch   | `0.2.0 → 0.2.1` |
| Pre-release / release candidate    | Suffix  | `0.3.0-rc.1`     |

### 2. Update the version in `Cargo.toml`

```bash
# Edit Cargo.toml — change the version field
# e.g., version = "0.2.0"
```

The extension control file (`pgtrickle.control`) uses
`default_version = '@CARGO_VERSION@'`, which pgrx replaces automatically at
build time — no manual edit needed.

### 3. Commit the version bump

```bash
git add Cargo.toml
git commit -m "release: v0.2.0"
git push origin main
```

### 4. Wait for CI to pass

Ensure the [CI workflow](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) passes on `main` with
the version bump commit. All unit, integration, E2E, and pgrx tests must be
green.

Before tagging, make sure the upgrade automation also targets the new release:

```bash
just check-upgrade <previous-version> <new-version>

# Confirm the local and CI upgrade-image / upgrade-E2E defaults
# were advanced to the new release where applicable.
```

### 5. Create and push the tag

```bash
git tag -a v0.2.0 -m "Release v0.2.0"
git push origin v0.2.0
```

This triggers the Release workflow automatically.

### 6. Monitor the release

Watch the [Actions tab](../../actions/workflows/release.yml) for progress.
The workflow runs these jobs in order:

```
build-release (linux, macos, windows)  ──►  test-release  ──►  publish-release
                                                           ──►  publish-docker
```

### 7. Make the GHCR package public (first release only)

When a package is pushed to GHCR for the first time it is **private** by
default. Because this is an open-source project, packages linked to the
public repository inherit public visibility — but you must make the package
public once to unlock that:

1. Go to **github.com/⟨owner⟩ → Packages → pg_trickle-ext**
2. Click **Package settings**
3. Scroll to **Danger Zone** → **Change package visibility** → set to **Public**

After that first change:
- All future pushes keep the package public automatically
- Unauthenticated `docker pull ghcr.io/grove/pg_trickle-ext:...` works
- Storage and bandwidth are free (GHCR open-source advantage)
- The package page shows the README, linked repository, license, and
  description from the OCI labels

### 8. Verify the release

Once the workflow completes:

- [ ] Check the [GitHub Releases](../../releases) page for the new release
- [ ] Verify all three platform archives are attached (`.tar.gz` for Linux/macOS, `.zip` for Windows)
- [ ] Verify `SHA256SUMS.txt` is present
- [ ] Verify the extension image is available at `ghcr.io/grove/pg_trickle-ext:<version>`
- [ ] Optionally verify the extension image layout:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/grove/pg_trickle-ext:<version>
ID=$(docker create ghcr.io/grove/pg_trickle-ext:<version>)
docker cp "$ID:/lib/" /tmp/ext-lib/
docker cp "$ID:/share/" /tmp/ext-share/
docker rm "$ID"
ls -la /tmp/ext-lib/ /tmp/ext-share/extension/
```

## Release Artifacts

Each release produces:

| Artifact | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `pg_trickle-<ver>-pg18-linux-amd64.tar.gz` | Extension files for Linux x86_64 |
| `pg_trickle-<ver>-pg18-macos-arm64.tar.gz` | Extension files for macOS Apple Silicon |
| `pg_trickle-<ver>-pg18-windows-amd64.zip`  | Extension files for Windows x64 |
| `SHA256SUMS.txt` | SHA-256 checksums for all archives |
| `ghcr.io/grove/pg_trickle-ext:<ver>` | CNPG extension image for Image Volumes (amd64 + arm64) |

### Installing from an archive

```bash
tar xzf pg_trickle-<version>-pg18-linux-amd64.tar.gz
cd pg_trickle-<version>-pg18-linux-amd64

sudo cp lib/*.so "$(pg_config --pkglibdir)/"
sudo cp extension/*.control extension/*.sql "$(pg_config --sharedir)/extension/"
```

Then add to `postgresql.conf` and restart:

```
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_trickle'
```

See [INSTALL.md](../INSTALL.md) for full installation details.

## Pre-releases

Tags containing `-rc`, `-beta`, or `-alpha` (e.g., `v0.3.0-rc.1`) are
automatically marked as pre-releases on GitHub. Pre-release extension images are
tagged but do **not** update the `latest` tag.

## Hotfix Releases

For urgent fixes on an older release:

```bash
# Branch from the tag
git checkout -b hotfix/v0.2.1 v0.2.0

# Apply fix, bump version to 0.2.1
git commit -am "fix: ..."
git push origin hotfix/v0.2.1

# Tag from the branch (CI will still run the release workflow)
git tag -a v0.2.1 -m "Release v0.2.1"
git push origin v0.2.1
```

## Files to Update for Each Release

Every release requires manual updates to the files below. Missing any of them leads to version skew between the code, the docs, and the packages.

| File | What to change | Why |
|------|----------------|-----|
| `Cargo.toml` | `version = "x.y.z"` field | The canonical version source. pgrx reads this at build time and substitutes it into `pg_trickle.control` via `@CARGO_VERSION@`. The git tag must match. |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Rename `## [Unreleased]` → `## [x.y.z] — YYYY-MM-DD`; add a new empty `## [Unreleased]` at the top | Keeps the public changelog accurate and gives downstream users a dated record of changes. |
| `ROADMAP.md` | Update the preamble's latest-release/current-milestone lines; mark the released milestone done; advance the "We are here" pointer to the next milestone | Keeps the forward-looking plan aligned with reality. Leaves no confusion about what just shipped versus what is next. |
| `README.md` | Update test-count line (`~N unit tests + M E2E tests`) if test counts changed significantly | The README is the first thing users read; stale numbers erode trust. |
| `INSTALL.md` | Update any version numbers in install commands or example URLs | Users copy-paste installation commands; stale versions cause failures. |
| `docs/UPGRADING.md` | Add the new version-specific migration notes and extend the supported upgrade-path table | Documents exactly what `ALTER EXTENSION ... UPDATE` will do and which chains are supported. |
| `sql/pg_trickle--<old>--<new>.sql` | Add or update the hand-authored upgrade script for every SQL-surface change (new objects, changed signatures, changed defaults, view changes) | `ALTER EXTENSION ... UPDATE` only applies what is explicitly scripted; function defaults and signatures stored in `pg_proc` do not update themselves. |
| `sql/archive/pg_trickle--<new>.sql` | Commit the generated full-install SQL baseline for the new version | Future upgrade-completeness checks and upgrade E2E tests need an exact baseline for the released version. |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `justfile`, `tests/build_e2e_upgrade_image.sh`, `tests/Dockerfile.e2e-upgrade` | Advance the upgrade-check chain and default upgrade-E2E target version to the new release | Prevents release automation and local upgrade validation from getting stuck on the previous version after a new migration hop is added. |
| `pg_trickle.control` | **No manual edit needed** — `default_version` is set to `'@CARGO_VERSION@'` and pgrx substitutes it at build time. Verify the substitution in the built artifact. | Ensures the SQL `CREATE EXTENSION` command installs the right version. |

## Troubleshooting

### Release workflow failed

Go to the [Actions tab](../../actions/workflows/release.yml) and identify
which job failed. Then follow the appropriate recovery path below.

#### Option A: Re-run (transient failure)

If the failure is transient — network timeout, registry hiccup, runner
issue — you can re-run without changing anything:

1. Open the failed workflow run in the **Actions** tab
2. Click **Re-run all jobs** (or re-run just the failed job)

This works because the `v*` tag still points to the same commit, and the
workflow uses `cancel-in-progress: false` so a re-run won't be cancelled.

#### Option B: Fix code and re-tag

If the failure is a real build or code issue:

```bash
# 1. Delete the remote tag
git push origin :refs/tags/v0.2.0

# 2. Delete the local tag
git tag -d v0.2.0

# 3. Fix the issue, commit, and push
git add <files>
git commit -m "fix: ..."
git push origin main

# 4. Re-tag on the new commit and push
git tag -a v0.2.0 -m "Release v0.2.0"
git push origin v0.2.0
```

This triggers a fresh release workflow run.

#### Option C: Clean up a partial GitHub Release

If the workflow created a draft or partial Release before failing:

1. Go to **Releases** in the repository
2. Delete the broken release (this does **not** delete the tag)
3. Then follow Option A or Option B above

#### Common failure causes

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Version mismatch error | `Cargo.toml` version doesn't match the git tag | Update `Cargo.toml`, commit, delete tag, re-tag (Option B) |
| Build failure | Compilation error in release profile | Fix on `main`, re-tag (Option B) |
| Docker push failed | Missing permissions | Verify `packages: write` is in the workflow and `GITHUB_TOKEN` has GHCR access, then re-run (Option A) |
| Smoke test failed | Extension doesn't load in PostgreSQL | Fix the issue, re-tag (Option B) |
| Rate limited | GitHub API or GHCR throttling | Wait a few minutes, then re-run (Option A) |

### Yanking a release

If a release has a critical issue:

1. Mark it as pre-release on the GitHub Releases page (uncheck "Set as the latest release")
2. Add a warning to the release notes
3. Publish a patch release with the fix

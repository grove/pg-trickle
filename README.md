**Stream Tables for PostgreSQL 18**

pg_trickle brings declarative, automatically-refreshing materialized views to PostgreSQL, inspired by the [DBSP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16684) differential dataflow framework ([comparison](docs/research/DBSP_COMPARISON.md)). Define a SQL query and a schedule bound (or cron schedule); the extension handles the rest.

## Key Features

- **Declarative** — define a query and a schedule bound (or cron expression); the extension schedules and executes refreshes automatically.
- **Three refresh modes** — `DIFFERENTIAL` (incremental delta), `FULL` (complete recomputation), and `IMMEDIATE` (synchronous in-transaction maintenance via statement-level triggers with transition tables).
- **Differential View Maintenance (DVM)** — only processes changed rows, not the entire base table. Delta queries are derived automatically from the defining query's operator tree.
- **Transactional IVM (IMMEDIATE mode)** — stream tables can be maintained **within the same transaction** as the base table DML, providing read-your-writes consistency. Supports window functions, LATERAL joins, scalar subqueries, cascading IMMEDIATE stream tables, and all DVM operators except recursive CTEs.
- **CTE Support** — full support for Common Table Expressions. Non-recursive CTEs are inlined and differentiated algebraically. Multi-reference CTEs share delta computation. Recursive CTEs (`WITH RECURSIVE`) work in both FULL and DIFFERENTIAL modes.
- **TopK support** — `ORDER BY ... LIMIT N` queries are accepted and refreshed correctly via scoped recomputation.
- **Trigger-based CDC** — lightweight `AFTER` row-level triggers capture changes into buffer tables. No logical replication slots or `wal_level = logical` required. Triggers are created and dropped automatically.
- **Hybrid CDC (optional)** — when `wal_level = logical` is available, the system can automatically transition from triggers to WAL-based (logical replication) capture for lower write-side overhead. Controlled by the `pg_trickle.cdc_mode` GUC (`trigger` / `auto` / `wal`).
- **DAG-aware scheduling** — stream tables that depend on other stream tables are refreshed in topological order. `CALCULATED` schedule propagation is supported.
- **Diamond dependency consistency** — diamond-shaped DAGs (A→B→D, A→C→D) can be refreshed atomically to prevent split-version reads.
- **Crash-safe** — advisory locks prevent concurrent refreshes; crash recovery marks in-flight refreshes as failed and resumes normal operation.
- **Observable** — built-in monitoring views (`pgtrickle.pg_stat_stream_tables`), refresh history, slot health checks, staleness reporting, and `NOTIFY`-based alerting.

## SQL Support

Every operator listed here works in `DIFFERENTIAL` mode (incremental delta computation) unless noted otherwise. `FULL` mode always works — it re-runs the entire query on each refresh.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- PostgreSQL 18.x
- Rust 1.82+ with [pgrx](https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx) 0.17.x

### Install

```bash
# Build and install the extension
cargo pgrx install --release --pg-config $(pg_config --bindir)/pg_config

# Or package for deployment
cargo pgrx package --pg-config $(pg_config --bindir)/pg_config
```

Add to `postgresql.conf`:

```ini
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_trickle'
max_worker_processes = 8
```

> **Note:** `wal_level = logical` and `max_replication_slots` are **not** required by default. CDC uses lightweight row-level triggers unless you opt in to WAL-based capture via `pg_trickle.cdc_mode = 'auto'` (see [CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md)).

Restart PostgreSQL, then:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_trickle;
```

### Kubernetes (CloudNativePG)

pg_trickle is distributed as a minimal OCI extension image for [CloudNativePG Image Volume Extensions](https://cloudnative-pg.io/docs/1.28/imagevolume_extensions/). The image is `scratch`-based (< 10 MB) and contains only the extension files — no PostgreSQL server, no OS.

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/grove/pg_trickle-ext:0.2.0
```

Deploy with the official CNPG PostgreSQL 18 operand image:

```yaml
# In your Cluster resource
spec:
  imageName: ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/postgresql:18
  postgresql:
    shared_preload_libraries: [pg_trickle]
    extensions:
      - name: pg-trickle
        image:
          reference: ghcr.io/grove/pg_trickle-ext:0.2.0
```

See [cnpg/cluster-example.yaml](cnpg/cluster-example.yaml) and [cnpg/database-example.yaml](cnpg/database-example.yaml) for complete examples. Requires Kubernetes 1.33+ and CNPG 1.28+.

### Usage

```sql
-- Create base tables
CREATE TABLE orders (
    id    INT PRIMARY KEY,
    region TEXT,
    amount NUMERIC
);

INSERT INTO orders VALUES
    (1, 'US', 100), (2, 'EU', 200),
    (3, 'US', 300), (4, 'APAC', 50);

-- Create a stream table with 1-minute schedule (DIFFERENTIAL mode)
SELECT pgtrickle.create_stream_table(
    'regional_totals',
    'SELECT region, SUM(amount) AS total, COUNT(*) AS cnt
     FROM orders GROUP BY region',
    '1m',
    'DIFFERENTIAL'
);

-- Or use IMMEDIATE mode: updated within the same transaction as DML
SELECT pgtrickle.create_stream_table(
    'regional_totals_live',
    'SELECT region, SUM(amount) AS total, COUNT(*) AS cnt
     FROM orders GROUP BY region',
    NULL,          -- no schedule needed
    'IMMEDIATE'
);

-- Or use a cron schedule with FULL refresh
SELECT pgtrickle.create_stream_table(
    'hourly_totals',
    'SELECT region, SUM(amount) AS total FROM orders GROUP BY region',
    '@hourly',
    'FULL'
);

-- Query the stream table like any regular table
SELECT * FROM regional_totals;

-- Manual refresh (scheduler also refreshes automatically)
SELECT pgtrickle.refresh_stream_table('regional_totals');

-- Check status
SELECT * FROM pgtrickle.pgt_status();

-- View monitoring stats
SELECT * FROM pgtrickle.pg_stat_stream_tables;

-- Drop when no longer needed
SELECT pgtrickle.drop_stream_table('regional_totals');
```

## Known Limitations

The following SQL features are **rejected with clear error messages** explaining the limitation and suggesting rewrites. See [FAQ — Why Are These SQL Features Not Supported?](docs/FAQ.md#why-are-these-sql-features-not-supported) for detailed technical explanations.

| Feature | Reason | Suggested Rewrite |
|---|---|---|
| Materialized views in DIFFERENTIAL | CDC triggers cannot track `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` | Use the underlying query directly, or use FULL mode |
| `TABLESAMPLE` | Stream tables materialize the complete result set; sampling at define-time is not meaningful | Use `WHERE random() < fraction` in the consuming query |
| Window functions in expressions | Window functions inside `CASE`, `COALESCE`, arithmetic, etc. cannot be differentially maintained | Move window function to a separate column |
| `LIMIT` / `OFFSET` without `ORDER BY` | Stream tables materialize the full result set; arbitrary row subsets are non-deterministic | Use `ORDER BY ... LIMIT N` for TopK, or apply LIMIT when querying the stream table |
| `FOR UPDATE` / `FOR SHARE` | Row-level locking not applicable | Remove the locking clause |
| Recursive CTEs in IMMEDIATE mode | Semi-naive fixpoint iteration not validated with transition tables | Use DIFFERENTIAL mode for recursive CTEs |

### Stream Table Restrictions

Stream tables are regular PostgreSQL heap tables, but their contents are managed exclusively by the refresh engine. See [FAQ — Why Are These Stream Table Operations Restricted?](docs/FAQ.md#why-are-these-stream-table-operations-restricted) for detailed explanations.

| Operation | Allowed? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ST references other STs | ✅ Yes | DAG-ordered refresh; cycles are rejected |
| Views reference STs | ✅ Yes | Standard PostgreSQL views work normally |
| Materialized views reference STs | ✅ Yes | Requires separate `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` |
| Logical replication of STs | ✅ Yes | `__pgt_row_id` column is replicated; subscribers receive materialized data only |
| Direct DML on STs | ❌ No | Contents managed by the refresh engine |
| Foreign keys on STs | ❌ No | Bulk `MERGE` during refresh does not respect FK ordering |
| User triggers on STs | ✅ Supported | Supported in DIFFERENTIAL mode; suppressed during FULL refresh (see `pg_trickle.user_triggers` GUC) |

See [SQL Reference — Restrictions & Interoperability](docs/SQL_REFERENCE.md#restrictions--interoperability) for details and examples.

## How It Works

### DIFFERENTIAL / FULL Mode (scheduled)

1. **Create** — `pgtrickle.create_stream_table()` parses the defining query into an operator tree, creates a storage table, installs lightweight CDC triggers on source tables, and registers the ST in the catalog.

2. **Capture** — Changes to base tables are captured via the hybrid CDC layer. By default, `AFTER INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE` row-level triggers write to per-source change buffer tables in the `pgtrickle_changes` schema. With `pg_trickle.cdc_mode = 'auto'`, the system transitions to WAL-based capture (logical replication) after the first successful refresh for lower write-side overhead.

3. **Schedule** — A background worker wakes periodically (default: 1s) and checks which STs have exceeded their schedule (or whose cron schedule has fired). STs are scheduled for refresh in topological order.

4. **Differentiate** — The DVM engine differentiates the defining query's operator tree to produce a delta query (ΔQ) that computes only the changes since the last refresh.

5. **Apply** — The delta query is executed and its results (INSERT/DELETE actions with row IDs) are merged into the storage table.

6. **Version** — Each refresh records a frontier (per-source LSN positions) and a data timestamp, implementing a simplified Data Versioning System (DVS).

### IMMEDIATE Mode (transactional)

When `refresh_mode = 'IMMEDIATE'`, the stream table is maintained **within the same transaction** as the base table DML:

1. **BEFORE triggers** acquire an advisory lock on the stream table.
2. **AFTER triggers** (with `REFERENCING NEW TABLE AS ... OLD TABLE AS ...`) copy transition tables to temp tables.
3. The DVM engine computes the delta from the transition tables (via `DeltaSource::TransitionTable`).
4. The delta is applied to the stream table via DELETE + INSERT ON CONFLICT.

No change buffer tables, no scheduler, no WAL infrastructure. The stream table is always up-to-date within the current transaction.

# pg_trickle — Project Roadmap

> **Last updated:** 2026-03-13
> **Latest release:** 0.4.0 (2026-03-12)
> **Current milestone:** v0.5.0 — Row-Level Security & Operational Controls

For a concise description of what pg_trickle is and why it exists, read
[ESSENCE.md](ESSENCE.md) — it explains the core problem (full `REFRESH
MATERIALIZED VIEW` recomputation), how the differential dataflow approach
solves it, the hybrid trigger→WAL CDC architecture, and the broad SQL
coverage, all in plain language.

---

## Overview

pg_trickle is a PostgreSQL 18 extension that implements streaming tables with
incremental view maintenance (IVM) via differential dataflow. All 13 design
phases are complete. This roadmap tracks the path from the v0.1.x series to
1.0 and beyond.

## v0.2.0 — TopK, Diamond Consistency & Transactional IVM

**Status: Released (2026-03-04).**

The 51-item SQL_GAPS_7 correctness plan was completed in v0.1.x. v0.2.0 delivers
three major feature additions.

<details>
<summary>Completed items (click to expand)</summary>

| Tier | Items | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| 0 — Critical | F1–F3, F5–F6 | ✅ Done in v0.1.1–v0.1.3 |
| 1 — Verification | F8–F10, F12 | ✅ Done in v0.1.2–v0.1.3 |
| 2 — Robustness | F13, F15–F16 | ✅ Done in v0.1.2–v0.1.3 |
| 3 — Test coverage | F17–F26 (62 E2E tests) | ✅ Done in v0.1.2–v0.1.3 |
| 4 — Operational hardening | F27–F39 | ✅ Done in v0.1.3 |
| 4 — Upgrade migrations | F40 | ✅ Done in v0.2.1 |
| 5 — Nice-to-have | F41–F51 | ✅ Done in v0.1.3 |

**TPC-H baseline:** 22/22 queries pass deterministic correctness checks across
multiple mutation cycles (`just test-tpch`, SF=0.01).

> *Queries are derived from the TPC-H Benchmark specification; results are not
> comparable to published TPC results. TPC Benchmark™ is a trademark of TPC.*

</details>

### ORDER BY / LIMIT / OFFSET — TopK Support ✅

> **In plain terms:** Stream tables can now be defined with `ORDER BY ... LIMIT N`
> — for example "keep the top 10 best-selling products". When the underlying data
> changes, only the top-N slot is updated incrementally rather than recomputing
> the entire sorted list from scratch every tick.

`ORDER BY ... LIMIT N` defining queries are accepted and refreshed correctly.
All 9 plan items (TK1–TK9) implemented, including 5 TPC-H queries with ORDER BY
restored (Q2, Q3, Q10, Q18, Q21).

| Item | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| TK1 | E2E tests for `FETCH FIRST` / `FETCH NEXT` rejection | ✅ Done |
| TK2 | OFFSET without ORDER BY warning in subqueries | ✅ Done |
| TK3 | `detect_topk_pattern()` + `TopKInfo` struct in `parser.rs` | ✅ Done |
| TK4 | Catalog columns: `pgt_topk_limit`, `pgt_topk_order_by` | ✅ Done |
| TK5 | TopK-aware refresh path (scoped recomputation via MERGE) | ✅ Done |
| TK6 | DVM pipeline bypass for TopK tables in `api.rs` | ✅ Done |
| TK7 | E2E + unit tests (`e2e_topk_tests.rs`, 18 tests) | ✅ Done |
| TK8 | Documentation (SQL Reference, FAQ, CHANGELOG) | ✅ Done |
| TK9 | TPC-H: restored ORDER BY + LIMIT in Q2, Q3, Q10, Q18, Q21 | ✅ Done |

See [PLAN_ORDER_BY_LIMIT_OFFSET.md](plans/sql/PLAN_ORDER_BY_LIMIT_OFFSET.md).

### Diamond Dependency Consistency ✅

> **In plain terms:** A "diamond" is when two stream tables share the same source
> (A → B, A → C) and a third (D) reads from both B and C. Without special
> handling, updating A could refresh B before C, leaving D briefly in an
> inconsistent state where it sees new-B but old-C. This groups B and C into an
> atomic refresh unit so D always sees them change together in a single step.

Atomic refresh groups eliminate the inconsistency window in diamond DAGs
(A→B→D, A→C→D). All 8 plan items (D1–D8) implemented.

| Item | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| D1 | Data structures (`Diamond`, `ConsistencyGroup`) in `dag.rs` | ✅ Done |
| D2 | Diamond detection algorithm in `dag.rs` | ✅ Done |
| D3 | Consistency group computation in `dag.rs` | ✅ Done |
| D4 | Catalog columns + GUCs (`diamond_consistency`, `diamond_schedule_policy`) | ✅ Done |
| D5 | Scheduler wiring with SAVEPOINT loop | ✅ Done |
| D6 | Monitoring function `pgtrickle.diamond_groups()` | ✅ Done |
| D7 | E2E test suite (`tests/e2e_diamond_tests.rs`) | ✅ Done |
| D8 | Documentation (`SQL_REFERENCE.md`, `CONFIGURATION.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`) | ✅ Done |

See [PLAN_DIAMOND_DEPENDENCY_CONSISTENCY.md](plans/sql/PLAN_DIAMOND_DEPENDENCY_CONSISTENCY.md).

### Transactional IVM — IMMEDIATE Mode ✅

> **In plain terms:** Normally stream tables refresh on a schedule (every N
> seconds). IMMEDIATE mode updates the stream table *inside the same database
> transaction* as the source table change — so by the time your INSERT/UPDATE/
> DELETE commits, the stream table is already up to date. Zero lag, at the cost
> of a slightly slower write.

New `IMMEDIATE` refresh mode that updates stream tables **within the same
transaction** as base table DML, using statement-level AFTER triggers with
transition tables. Phase 1 (core engine) and Phase 3 (extended SQL support)
are complete. Phase 2 (pg_ivm compatibility layer) is postponed. Phase 4
(performance optimizations) has partial completion (delta SQL template caching).

| Item | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| TI1 | `RefreshMode::Immediate` enum, catalog CHECK, API validation | ✅ Done |
| TI2 | Statement-level IVM trigger functions with transition tables | ✅ Done |
| TI3 | `DeltaSource::TransitionTable` — Scan operator dual-path | ✅ Done |
| TI4 | Delta application (DELETE + INSERT ON CONFLICT) | ✅ Done |
| TI5 | Advisory lock-based concurrency (`IvmLockMode`) | ✅ Done |
| TI6 | TRUNCATE handling (full refresh of stream table) | ✅ Done |
| TI7 | `alter_stream_table` mode switching (DIFFERENTIAL↔IMMEDIATE, FULL↔IMMEDIATE) | ✅ Done |
| TI8 | Query restriction validation (`validate_immediate_mode_support`) | ✅ Done |
| TI9 | Delta SQL template caching (thread-local `IVM_DELTA_CACHE`) | ✅ Done |
| TI10 | Window functions, LATERAL, scalar subqueries in IMMEDIATE mode | ✅ Done |
| TI11 | Cascading IMMEDIATE stream tables (ST_A → ST_B) | ✅ Done |
| TI12 | 29 E2E tests + 8 unit tests | ✅ Done |
| TI13 | Documentation (SQL Reference, Architecture, FAQ, CHANGELOG) | ✅ Done |

> Remaining performance optimizations (ENR-based transition table access,
> aggregate fast-path, C-level trigger functions, prepared statement reuse)
> are tracked under post-1.0 A2.

See [PLAN_TRANSACTIONAL_IVM.md](plans/sql/PLAN_TRANSACTIONAL_IVM.md).

**Exit criteria:**
- [x] `ORDER BY ... LIMIT N` (TopK) defining queries accepted and refreshed correctly
- [x] TPC-H queries Q2, Q3, Q10, Q18, Q21 pass with original LIMIT restored
- [x] Diamond dependency consistency (D1–D8) implemented and E2E-tested
- [x] IMMEDIATE refresh mode: INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on base table updates stream table within the same transaction
- [x] Window functions, LATERAL, scalar subqueries work in IMMEDIATE mode
- [x] Cascading IMMEDIATE stream tables (ST_A → ST_B) propagate correctly
- [x] Concurrent transaction tests pass

## v0.2.1 — Upgrade Infrastructure & Documentation

**Status: Released (2026-03-05).**

Patch release focused on upgrade safety, documentation, and three catalog
schema additions via `sql/pg_trickle--0.2.0--0.2.1.sql`:

- `has_keyless_source BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE` — EC-06 keyless source
  flag; changes apply strategy from MERGE to counted DELETE when set.
- `function_hashes TEXT` — EC-16 function-body hash map; forces a full
  refresh when a referenced function's body changes silently.
- `topk_offset INT` — OS2 catalog field for paged TopK OFFSET support,
  shipped and used in this release.

### Upgrade Migration Infrastructure ✅

> **In plain terms:** When you run `ALTER EXTENSION pg_trickle UPDATE`, all your
> stream tables should survive intact. This adds the safety net that makes that
> true: automated scripts that check every upgrade script covers all database
> objects, real end-to-end tests that actually perform the upgrade in a test
> container, and CI gates that catch regressions before they reach users.

Complete safety net for `ALTER EXTENSION pg_trickle UPDATE`:

| Item | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| U1 | `scripts/check_upgrade_completeness.sh` — CI completeness checker | ✅ Done |
| U2 | `sql/archive/` with archived SQL baselines per version | ✅ Done |
| U3 | `tests/Dockerfile.e2e-upgrade` for real upgrade tests | ✅ Done |
| U4 | 6 upgrade E2E tests (function parity, stream table survival, etc.) | ✅ Done |
| U5 | CI: `upgrade-check` (every PR) + `upgrade-e2e` (push-to-main) | ✅ Done |
| U6 | `docs/UPGRADING.md` user-facing upgrade guide | ✅ Done |
| U7 | `just check-upgrade`, `just build-upgrade-image`, `just test-upgrade` | ✅ Done |
| U8 | Fixed 0.1.3→0.2.0 upgrade script (was no-op placeholder) | ✅ Done |

### Documentation Expansion ✅

> **In plain terms:** Added six new pages to the documentation book: a dbt
> integration guide, contributing guide, security policy, release process, a
> comparison with the pg_ivm extension, and a deep-dive explaining why
> row-level triggers were chosen over logical replication for CDC.

GitHub Pages book grew from 14 to 20 pages:

| Page | Section | Source |
|------|---------|--------|
| dbt Integration | Integrations | `dbt-pgtrickle/README.md` |
| Contributing | Reference | `CONTRIBUTING.md` |
| Security Policy | Reference | `SECURITY.md` |
| Release Process | Reference | `docs/RELEASE.md` |
| pg_ivm Comparison | Research | `plans/ecosystem/GAP_PG_IVM_COMPARISON.md` |
| Triggers vs Replication | Research | `plans/sql/REPORT_TRIGGERS_VS_REPLICATION.md` |

**Exit criteria:**
- [x] `ALTER EXTENSION pg_trickle UPDATE` from 0.1.3→0.2.0 tested end-to-end
- [x] Completeness check passes (upgrade script covers all pgrx-generated SQL objects)
- [x] CI enforces upgrade script completeness on every PR
- [x] All documentation pages build and render in mdBook

## v0.2.2 — OFFSET, AUTO Mode, ALTER QUERY, Edge Cases & CDC Hardening

**Status: Released (2026-03-08).**

This milestone shipped paged TopK OFFSET support, AUTO-by-default refresh
selection, ALTER QUERY, the remaining upgrade-tooling work, edge-case and WAL
CDC hardening, IMMEDIATE-mode parity fixes, and the outstanding documentation
sweep.

### ORDER BY + LIMIT + OFFSET (Paged TopK) — Finalization ✅

> **In plain terms:** Extends TopK to support OFFSET — so you can define a
> stream table as "rows 11–20 of the top-20 best-selling products" (page 2 of
> a ranked list). Useful for paginated leaderboards, ranked feeds, or any
> use case where you want a specific window into a sorted result.

Core implementation is complete (parser, catalog, refresh path, docs, 9 E2E
tests). The `topk_offset` catalog column shipped in v0.2.1 and is exercised
by the paged TopK feature here.

| Item | Description | Status | Ref |
|------|-------------|--------|-----|
| OS1 | 9 OFFSET E2E tests in `e2e_topk_tests.rs` | ✅ Done | [PLAN_OFFSET_SUPPORT.md](plans/sql/PLAN_OFFSET_SUPPORT.md) §Step 6 |
| OS2 | `sql/pg_trickle--0.2.1--0.2.2.sql` — function signature updates (no schema DDL needed) | ✅ Done | [PLAN_OFFSET_SUPPORT.md](plans/sql/PLAN_OFFSET_SUPPORT.md) §Step 2 |

### AUTO Refresh Mode ✅

> **In plain terms:** Changes the default from "always try differential
> (incremental) refresh" to a smart automatic selection: use differential when
> the query supports it, fall back to a full re-scan when it doesn't. New stream
> tables also get a calculated schedule interval instead of a hardcoded
> 1-minute default.

| Item | Description | Status | Ref |
|------|-------------|--------|-----|
| AM1 | `RefreshMode::Auto` — uses DIFFERENTIAL when supported, falls back to FULL | ✅ Done | [PLAN_REFRESH_MODE_DEFAULT.md](plans/sql/PLAN_REFRESH_MODE_DEFAULT.md) |
| AM2 | `create_stream_table` default changed from `'DIFFERENTIAL'` to `'AUTO'` | ✅ Done | — |
| AM3 | `create_stream_table` schedule default changed from `'1m'` to `'calculated'` | ✅ Done | — |

### ALTER QUERY ✅

> **In plain terms:** Lets you change the SQL query of an existing stream table
> without dropping and recreating it. pg_trickle inspects the old and new
> queries, determines what type of change was made (added a column, dropped a
> column, or fundamentally incompatible change), and performs the most minimal
> migration possible — updating in place where it can, rebuilding only when it
> must.

| Item | Description | Status | Ref |
|------|-------------|--------|-----|
| AQ1 | `alter_stream_table(query => ...)` — validate, classify schema change, migrate storage | ✅ Done | [PLAN_ALTER_QUERY.md](plans/PLAN_ALTER_QUERY.md) |
| AQ2 | Schema classification: same, compatible (ADD/DROP COLUMN), incompatible (full rebuild) | ✅ Done | — |
| AQ3 | ALTER-aware cycle detection (`check_for_cycles_alter`) | ✅ Done | — |
| AQ4 | CDC dependency migration (add/remove triggers for changed sources) | ✅ Done | — |
| AQ5 | SQL Reference & CHANGELOG documentation | ✅ Done | — |

### Upgrade Tooling ✅

> **In plain terms:** If the compiled extension library (`.so` file) is a
> different version than the SQL objects in the database, the scheduler now
> warns loudly at startup instead of failing in confusing ways later. Also
> adds FAQ entries and cross-links for common upgrade questions.

| Item | Description | Status | Ref |
|------|-------------|--------|-----|
| UG1 | Version mismatch check — scheduler warns if `.so` version ≠ SQL version | ✅ Done | [PLAN_UPGRADE_MIGRATIONS.md](plans/sql/PLAN_UPGRADE_MIGRATIONS.md) §5.2 |
| UG2 | FAQ upgrade section — 3 new entries with UPGRADING.md cross-links | ✅ Done | [PLAN_UPGRADE_MIGRATIONS.md](plans/sql/PLAN_UPGRADE_MIGRATIONS.md) §5.4 |
| UG3 | CI and local upgrade automation now target 0.2.2 (`upgrade-check`, upgrade-image defaults, upgrade E2E env) | ✅ Done | [PLAN_UPGRADE_MIGRATIONS.md](plans/sql/PLAN_UPGRADE_MIGRATIONS.md) |

### IMMEDIATE Mode Parity ✅

> **In plain terms:** Closes two remaining SQL patterns that worked in
> DIFFERENTIAL mode but not in IMMEDIATE mode. Recursive CTEs (queries that
> reference themselves to compute e.g. graph reachability or org-chart
> hierarchies) now work in IMMEDIATE mode with a configurable depth guard.
> TopK (ORDER BY + LIMIT) queries also get a dedicated fast micro-refresh path
> in IMMEDIATE mode.

Close the gap between DIFFERENTIAL and IMMEDIATE mode SQL coverage for the
two remaining high-risk patterns — recursive CTEs and TopK queries.

| Item | Description | Effort | Ref |
|------|-------------|--------|-----|
| IM1 | Validate recursive CTE semi-naive in IMMEDIATE mode; add stack-depth guard for deeply recursive defining queries | 2–3d | [PLAN_EDGE_CASES_TIVM_IMPL_ORDER.md](plans/PLAN_EDGE_CASES_TIVM_IMPL_ORDER.md) Stage 6 §5.1 | ✅ Done — `check_for_delete_changes` handles `TransitionTable`; `generate_change_buffer_from` uses NEW transition table in IMMEDIATE mode; `ivm_recursive_max_depth` GUC (default 100) injects `__pgt_depth` counter into semi-naive SQL |
| IM2 | TopK in IMMEDIATE mode: statement-level micro-refresh + `ivm_topk_max_limit` GUC | 2–3d | [PLAN_EDGE_CASES_TIVM_IMPL_ORDER.md](plans/PLAN_EDGE_CASES_TIVM_IMPL_ORDER.md) Stage 6 §5.2 | ✅ Done — `apply_topk_micro_refresh()` in ivm.rs; GUC threshold check in api.rs; 10 E2E tests (basic, insert, delete, update, aggregate, offset, multi-DML, threshold rejection, mode switch) |

> **IMMEDIATE parity subtotal: ✅ Complete (IM1 + IM2)**

### Edge Case Hardening ✅

> **In plain terms:** Three targeted fixes for uncommon-but-real scenarios:
> a cap on CUBE/ROLLUP combinatorial explosion (which can generate thousands
> of grouping variants from a single query and crash the database); automatic
> recovery when CDC gets stuck in a "transitioning" state after a database
> restart; and polling-based change detection for foreign tables (tables in
> external databases) that can't use triggers or WAL.

Self-contained items from Stage 7 of the edge-cases/TIVM implementation plan.

| Item | Description | Effort | Ref |
|------|-------------|--------|-----|
| EC1 | `pg_trickle.max_grouping_set_branches` GUC — cap CUBE/ROLLUP branch-count explosion | 4h | [PLAN_EDGE_CASES.md](plans/PLAN_EDGE_CASES.md) EC-02 | ✅ Done — GUC in config.rs (default 64, range 1–65536); parser.rs rejects when branch count exceeds limit; 3 E2E tests (rejection, within-limit, raised limit) |
| EC2 | Post-restart CDC `TRANSITIONING` health check — detect stuck CDC transitions after crash or restart | 1d | [PLAN_EDGE_CASES.md](plans/PLAN_EDGE_CASES.md) EC-20 | ✅ Done — `check_cdc_transition_health()` in scheduler.rs; detects missing replication slots; rolls back to TRIGGER mode |
| EC3 | Foreign table support: polling-based change detection via periodic re-execution | 2–3d | [PLAN_EDGE_CASES.md](plans/PLAN_EDGE_CASES.md) EC-05 | ✅ Done — `pg_trickle.foreign_table_polling` GUC; `setup_foreign_table_polling()` creates snapshot table; `poll_foreign_table_changes()` uses EXCEPT ALL deltas; 3 E2E tests (rejection, FULL mode, polling correctness) |

> **Edge-case hardening subtotal: ✅ Complete (EC1 + EC2 + EC3)**

### Documentation Sweep

> **In plain terms:** Filled three documentation gaps: what happens to an
> in-flight refresh if you run DDL (ALTER TABLE, DROP INDEX) at the same time;
> limitations when using pg_trickle on standby replicas; and a PgBouncer
> configuration guide explaining the session-mode requirement and incompatible
> settings.

Remaining documentation gaps identified in Stage 7 of the gap analysis.

| Item | Description | Effort | Status | Ref |
|------|-------------|--------|--------|-----|
| DS1 | DDL-during-refresh behaviour: document safe patterns and races | 2h | ✅ Done | [PLAN_EDGE_CASES.md](plans/PLAN_EDGE_CASES.md) EC-17 |
| DS2 | Replication/standby limitations: document in FAQ and Architecture | 3h | ✅ Done | [PLAN_EDGE_CASES.md](plans/PLAN_EDGE_CASES.md) EC-21/22/23 |
| DS3 | PgBouncer configuration guide: session-mode requirements and known incompatibilities | 2h | ✅ Done | [PLAN_EDGE_CASES.md](plans/PLAN_EDGE_CASES.md) EC-28 |

> **Documentation sweep subtotal: ✅ Complete**

### WAL CDC Hardening

> **In plain terms:** WAL (Write-Ahead Log) mode tracks changes by reading
> PostgreSQL's internal replication stream rather than using row-level triggers
> — which is more efficient and works across concurrent sessions. This work
> added a complete E2E test suite for WAL mode, hardened the automatic fallback
> from WAL to trigger mode when WAL isn't available, and promoted `cdc_mode =
> 'auto'` (try WAL first, fall back to triggers) as the default.

> WAL decoder F2–F3 fixes (keyless pk_hash, `old_*` columns for UPDATE) landed in v0.1.3.

| Item | Description | Effort | Status | Ref |
|------|-------------|--------|--------|-----|
| W1 | WAL mode E2E test suite (parallel to trigger suite) | 8–12h | ✅ Done | [PLAN_HYBRID_CDC.md](plans/sql/PLAN_HYBRID_CDC.md) |
| W2 | WAL→trigger automatic fallback hardening | 4–6h | ✅ Done | [PLAN_HYBRID_CDC.md](plans/sql/PLAN_HYBRID_CDC.md) |
| W3 | Promote `pg_trickle.cdc_mode = 'auto'` to default | ~1h | ✅ Done | [PLAN_HYBRID_CDC.md](plans/sql/PLAN_HYBRID_CDC.md) |

> **WAL CDC subtotal: ~13–19 hours**

**Exit criteria:**
- [x] `ORDER BY + LIMIT + OFFSET` defining queries accepted, refreshed, and E2E-tested
- [x] `sql/pg_trickle--0.2.1--0.2.2.sql` exists (column pre-provisioned in 0.2.1; function signature updates)

## v0.2.3 — Non-Determinism, CDC/Mode Gaps & Operational Polish

**Goal:** Close a small set of high-leverage correctness and operational gaps
that do not need to wait for the larger v0.3.0 parallel refresh, security, and
partitioning work.
This milestone tightens refresh-mode behavior, makes CDC transitions easier to
observe, and removes one silent correctness hazard in DIFFERENTIAL mode.

### Non-Deterministic Function Handling

> **In plain terms:** Functions like `random()`, `gen_random_uuid()`, and
> `clock_timestamp()` return a different value every time they're called. In
> DIFFERENTIAL mode, pg_trickle computes *what changed* between the old and
> new result — but if a function changes on every call, the "change" is
> meaningless and produces phantom rows. This detects such functions at
> stream-table creation time and rejects them in DIFFERENTIAL mode (they still
> work fine in FULL or IMMEDIATE mode).

Status: Done. Volatility lookup, OpTree enforcement, E2E coverage, and
documentation are complete.

Volatile functions (`random()`, `gen_random_uuid()`, `clock_timestamp()`) break
delta computation in DIFFERENTIAL mode — values change on each evaluation,
causing phantom changes and corrupted row identity hashes. This is a silent
correctness gap.

| Item | Description | Effort | Ref |

### CDC / Refresh Mode Interaction Gaps ✅

> **In plain terms:** pg_trickle has four CDC modes (trigger, WAL, auto,
> per-table override) and four refresh modes (FULL, DIFFERENTIAL, IMMEDIATE,
> AUTO). Not every combination makes sense, and some had silent bugs. This
> fixed six specific gaps: stale change buffers not being flushed after FULL
> refreshes (so they got replayed again on the next tick), a missing error for
> the IMMEDIATE + WAL combination, a new `pgt_cdc_status` monitoring view,
> per-table CDC mode overrides, and a guard against refreshing stream tables
> that haven't been populated yet.

Six gaps between the four CDC modes and four refresh modes — missing
validations, resource leaks, and observability holes. Phased from quick wins
(pure Rust) to a larger feature (per-table `cdc_mode` override).

## v0.3.0 — DVM Correctness, SAST & Test Coverage

**Goal:** Re-enable all 18 previously-ignored DVM correctness E2E tests by
fixing HAVING, FULL OUTER JOIN, correlated EXISTS+HAVING, and correlated scalar
subquery differential computation bugs. Harden the SAST toolchain with
privilege-context rules and an unsafe-block baseline. Expand TPC-H coverage
with rollback, mode-comparison, single-row, and DAG tests.

### DVM Correctness Fixes

> **In plain terms:** The Differential View Maintenance engine — the core
> algorithm that computes *what changed* incrementally — had four correctness
> bugs in specific SQL patterns. Queries using these patterns were silently
> producing wrong results and had their tests marked "ignored". This release
> fixes all four: HAVING clauses on aggregates, FULL OUTER JOINs, correlated
> EXISTS subqueries combined with HAVING, and correlated scalar subqueries in
> SELECT lists. All 18 previously-ignored E2E tests now pass.

## v0.4.0 — Parallel Refresh & Performance Hardening

**Goal:** Deliver true parallel refresh, cut write-side CDC overhead with
statement-level triggers, close a cross-source snapshot consistency gap, and
ship quick ergonomic and infrastructure improvements. Together these close the
main performance and operational gaps before the security and partitioning
work begins.

### Parallel Refresh

> **In plain terms:** Right now the scheduler refreshes stream tables one at
> a time. This feature lets multiple stream tables refresh simultaneously —
> like running several errands at once instead of in a queue. When you have
> dozens of stream tables, this can cut total refresh latency dramatically.

Detailed implementation is tracked in
[PLAN_PARALLELISM.md](plans/sql/PLAN_PARALLELISM.md). The older
[REPORT_PARALLELIZATION.md](plans/performance/REPORT_PARALLELIZATION.md)
remains the options-analysis precursor.

| Item | Description | Effort | Ref |
|------|-------------|--------|-----|
| P1 | Phase 0–1: instrumentation, `dry_run`, and execution-unit DAG (atomic groups + IMMEDIATE closures) | 12–20h | [PLAN_PARALLELISM.md §10](plans/sql/PLAN_PARALLELISM.md) |
| P2 | Phase 2–4: job table, worker budget, dynamic refresh workers, and ready-queue dispatch | 16–28h | [PLAN_PARALLELISM.md §10](plans/sql/PLAN_PARALLELISM.md) |
| P3 | Phase 5–7: composite units, observability, rollout gating, and CI validation | 12–24h | [PLAN_PARALLELISM.md §10](plans/sql/PLAN_PARALLELISM.md) |

**Progress:**
- [x] **P1 — Phase 0 + Phase 1** (done): GUCs (`parallel_refresh_mode`, `max_dynamic_refresh_workers`), `ExecutionUnit`/`ExecutionUnitDag` types in `dag.rs`, IMMEDIATE-closure collapsing, dry-run logging in scheduler, 10 new unit tests (1211 total).
- [x] **P2 — Phase 2–4** (done): Job table (`pgt_scheduler_jobs`), catalog CRUD, shared-memory token pool (Phase 2). Dynamic worker entry point, spawn helper, reconciliation (Phase 3). Coordinator dispatch loop with ready-queue scheduling, per-db/cluster-wide budget enforcement, transaction-split spawning, dynamic poll interval, 8 new unit tests (Phase 4). 1233 unit tests total.
- [x] **P3a — Phase 5** (done): Composite unit execution — `execute_worker_atomic_group()` with C-level sub-transaction rollback, `execute_worker_immediate_closure()` with root-only refresh (IMMEDIATE triggers propagate downstream). Replaces Phase 3 serial placeholder.
- [x] **P3b — Phase 6** (done): Observability — `worker_pool_status()`, `parallel_job_status()` SQL functions; `health_check()` extended with `worker_pool` and `job_queue` checks; docs updated.
- [x] **P3c — Phase 7** (done): Rollout — GUC documentation in `CONFIGURATION.md`, worker-budget guidance in `ARCHITECTURE.md`, CI E2E coverage with `PGT_PARALLEL_MODE=on`, feature stays gated behind `parallel_refresh_mode = 'off'` default.

> **Parallel refresh subtotal: ~40–72 hours**

### Statement-Level CDC Triggers

> **In plain terms:** Previously, when you updated 1,000 rows in a source
> table, the database fired a "row changed" notification 1,000 times — once
> per row. Now it fires once per statement, handing off all 1,000 changed
> rows in a single batch. For bulk operations like data imports or batch
> updates this is 50–80% cheaper; for single-row changes you won't notice a
> difference.

Replace per-row AFTER triggers with statement-level triggers using
`NEW TABLE AS __pgt_new` / `OLD TABLE AS __pgt_old`. Expected write-side
trigger overhead reduction of 50–80% for bulk DML; neutral for single-row.

> **Statement-level CDC subtotal: ✅ All done (~14h)**

### Cross-Source Snapshot Consistency (Phase 1)

> **In plain terms:** Imagine a stream table that joins `orders` and
> `customers`. If a single transaction updates both tables, the old scheduler
> could read the new `orders` data but the old `customers` data — a
> half-applied, internally inconsistent snapshot. This fix takes a "freeze
> frame" of the change log at the start of each scheduler tick and only
> processes changes up to that point, so all sources are always read from the
> same moment in time. Zero configuration required.

At start of each scheduler tick, snapshot `pg_current_wal_lsn()` as a
`tick_watermark` and cap all CDC consumption to that LSN. Zero user
configuration — prevents interleaved reads from two sources that were
updated in the same transaction from producing an inconsistent stream table.

> **Cross-source consistency subtotal: ✅ All done**

### Ergonomic Hardening

> **In plain terms:** Added helpful warning messages for common mistakes:
> "your WAL level isn't configured for logical replication", "this source
> table has no primary key — duplicate rows may appear", "this change will
> trigger a full re-scan of all source data". Think of these as friendly
> guardrails that explain *why* something might not work as expected.

## v0.5.0 — Row-Level Security & Operational Controls

**Goal:** Harden the security context for stream tables and IVM triggers,
add source-level pause/resume gating for bulk-load coordination, and deliver
small ergonomic improvements.

### Row-Level Security (RLS) Support

> **In plain terms:** Row-level security lets you write policies like "user
> Alice can only see rows where `tenant_id = 'alice'`". Stream tables already
> honour these policies when users query them. What this work fixes is the
> *machinery behind the scenes* — the triggers and refresh functions that
> build the stream table need to see *all* rows regardless of who is running
> them, otherwise they'd produce an incomplete result. This phase hardens
> those internal components so they always have full visibility, while
> end-users still see only their filtered slice.

Stream tables materialize the full result set (like `MATERIALIZED VIEW`). RLS
is applied on the stream table itself for read-side filtering. Phase 1
hardens the security context; Phase 2 adds a tutorial; Phase 3 completes DDL
tracking. Phase 4 (per-role `security_invoker`) is deferred to post-1.0.

### Bootstrap Source Gating

> **In plain terms:** A pause/resume switch for individual source tables.
> If you're bulk-loading 10 million rows into a source table (a nightly ETL
> import, for example), you can "gate" it first — the scheduler will skip
> refreshing any stream table that reads from it. Once the load is done you
> "ungate" it and a single clean refresh runs. Without gating, the CDC system
> would frantically process millions of intermediate changes during the load,
> most of which get immediately overwritten anyway.

Allow operators to pause CDC consumption for specific source tables (e.g.
during bulk loads or ETL windows) without dropping and recreating stream
tables. The scheduler skips any stream table whose transitive source set
intersects the current gated set.

## v0.6.0 — Partitioning, Idempotent DDL & Anomaly Detection

**Goal:** Validate partitioned source tables, add `create_or_replace_stream_table`
for idempotent deployments (critical for dbt and migration workflows), protect
against anomalous change spikes with a configurable fuse, and lay the
foundation for circular stream table DAGs.

### Partitioning Support (Source Tables)

> **In plain terms:** PostgreSQL lets you split large tables into smaller
> "partitions" — for example one partition per month for an `orders` table.
> This is a common technique for managing very large datasets. This work
> teaches pg_trickle to track all those partitions as a unit, so adding a
> new monthly partition doesn't silently break stream tables that depend on
> `orders`. It also handles the special case of foreign tables (tables that
> live in another database), restricting them to full-scan refresh since they
> can't be change-tracked the normal way.

### Idempotent DDL (`create_or_replace`)

> **In plain terms:** Right now if you run `create_stream_table()` twice with
> the same name it errors out, and changing the query means
> `drop_stream_table()` followed by `create_stream_table()` — which loses all
> the data in between. `create_or_replace_stream_table()` does the right
> thing automatically: if nothing changed it's a no-op, if only settings
> changed it updates in place, if the query changed it rebuilds. This is the
> same pattern as `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION` in PostgreSQL — and it's
> exactly what the dbt materialization macro needs so every `dbt run` doesn't
> drop and recreate tables from scratch.

`create_or_replace_stream_table()` performs a smart diff: no-op if identical,
in-place alter for config-only changes, schema migration for ADD/DROP column,
full rebuild for incompatible changes. Eliminates the drop-and-recreate
pattern used by the dbt materialization macro.

### Anomalous Change Detection (Fuse)

> **In plain terms:** Imagine a source table suddenly receives a
> million-row batch delete — a bug, runaway script, or intentional purge.
> Without a fuse, pg_trickle would try to process all of it and potentially
> overload the database. This adds a circuit breaker: you set a ceiling
> (e.g. "never process more than 50,000 changes at once"), and if that
> limit is hit the stream table pauses and sends a notification. You
> investigate, fix the root cause, then resume with `reset_fuse()` and
> choose how to recover (apply the changes, reinitialize from scratch, or
> skip them entirely).

Per-stream-table fuse that blows when the change buffer row count exceeds a
configurable fixed ceiling or an adaptive μ+kσ threshold derived from
`pgt_refresh_history`. A blown fuse halts refresh and emits a
`pgtrickle_alert` NOTIFY; `reset_fuse()` resumes with a chosen recovery
action.

### Circular Dependency Foundation

> **In plain terms:** Normally stream tables form a one-way chain: A feeds
> B, B feeds C. A circular dependency means A feeds B which feeds A —
> usually a mistake, but occasionally useful for iterative computations like
> graph reachability or recursive aggregations. This lays the groundwork —
> the algorithms, catalog columns, and GUC settings — to eventually allow
> controlled circular stream tables. The actual live execution is completed
> in v0.7.0.

## v0.7.0 — PostgreSQL Backward Compatibility, Watermarks & Circular DAGs

**Goal:** Widen the deployment target to PG 16–18, add user-injected temporal
watermark gating for batch-ETL coordination, and complete the fixpoint
scheduler for circular stream table DAGs.

### PostgreSQL Backward Compatibility (PG 16–18)

> **In plain terms:** pg_trickle currently only targets PostgreSQL 18. This
> work adds support for PG 16 and PG 17 so teams that haven't yet upgraded
> can still use the extension. Each PostgreSQL major version has subtly
> different internal APIs — especially around query parsing and the WAL

### Watermark Gating

> **In plain terms:** A scheduling control for ETL pipelines where multiple
> source tables are populated by separate jobs that finish at different
> times. For example, `orders` might be loaded by a job that finishes at
> 02:00 and `products` by one that finishes at 03:00. Without watermarks,
> the scheduler might refresh a stream table that joins the two at 02:30,
> producing a half-complete result. Watermarks let each ETL job declare "I'm
> done up to timestamp X", and the scheduler waits until all sources are
> caught up within a configurable tolerance before proceeding.

Let producers signal their progress so the scheduler only refreshes stream
tables when all contributing sources are aligned within a configurable
tolerance. The primary use case is nightly batch ETL pipelines where multiple
source tables are populated on different schedules.

### Circular Dependencies — Scheduler Integration

> **In plain terms:** Completes the circular DAG work started in v0.6.0.
> When stream tables reference each other in a cycle (A → B → A), the
> scheduler now runs them repeatedly until the result stabilises — no more
> changes flowing through the cycle. This is called "fixpoint iteration",
> like solving a system of equations by re-running it until the numbers stop
> moving. If it doesn't converge within a configurable number of rounds
> (default 100) it surfaces an error rather than looping forever.

## v0.8.0 — Connection Pooler, External Tests & Native DDL Syntax

**Goal:** Enable cloud-native PgBouncer transaction-mode deployments, validate
correctness against independent query corpora, and add `CREATE MATERIALIZED
VIEW … WITH (pgtrickle.stream = true)` DDL syntax so stream tables feel native
to PostgreSQL tooling (pg_dump, ORMs, `\dm`). Requires
`shared_preload_libraries`.

### Connection Pooler Compatibility

> **In plain terms:** PgBouncer is the most widely used PostgreSQL connection
> pooler — it sits in front of the database and reuses connections across
> many application threads. In its common "transaction mode" it hands a
> different physical connection to each transaction, which breaks anything
> that assumes the same connection persists between calls (session locks,
> prepared statements). This work replaces all such session-scoped state in
> pg_trickle so it works correctly in cloud deployments — Supabase, Railway,
> Neon, and similar platforms that route through PgBouncer by default.

pg_trickle uses session-level advisory locks and `PREPARE` statements that are
incompatible with PgBouncer transaction-mode pooling. This section replaces all
session-scoped state with transaction-scoped equivalents.

### External Test Suite Integration

> **In plain terms:** pg_trickle's own tests were written by the pg_trickle
> team, which means they can have the same blind spots as the code. This
> adds validation against three independent public benchmarks: PostgreSQL's
> own SQL conformance suite (sqllogictest), the Join Order Benchmark (a
> realistic analytical query workload), and Nexmark (a streaming data
> benchmark). If pg_trickle produces a different answer than PostgreSQL does

### Native DDL Syntax

> introspect them, and migration tools like Flyway treat them like ordinary
> database objects. Stream tables finally look native to PostgreSQL tooling.

Intercept `CREATE/DROP/REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` via `ProcessUtility_hook`
and route stream-table variants through the existing internal implementations.
Allows existing SQL tooling — pg_dump, `\dm`, ORMs — to interact with stream
tables naturally without calling `pgtrickle.create_stream_table()`.

## v0.9.0 — Observability & Integration

**Goal:** Prometheus/Grafana observability, dbt-pgtrickle formal release, and
complete documentation review. After this milestone the product is externally
visible and monitored.

### Observability

> **In plain terms:** Adds ready-made dashboards and metrics exports so you
> can see pg_trickle's health in existing monitoring systems without
> building them yourself. The Grafana dashboard gives you a live graph of
> refresh latency, how "stale" each stream table is, and how far behind CDC
> is — the same kind of operational visibility you'd expect from any

### pg_dump / pg_restore Support

> **In plain terms:** `pg_dump` is the standard PostgreSQL backup tool.
> Without this, a dump of a database containing stream tables may not
> capture them correctly — and restoring from that dump would require
> manually recreating them by hand. This teaches `pg_dump` to emit valid
> SQL for every stream table, and adds logic to automatically re-link
> orphaned catalog entries when restoring an extension from a backup.

Complete the native DDL story: teach pg_dump to emit `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW
… WITH (pgtrickle.stream = true)` for stream tables and add an event trigger

## v0.10.0 — Incremental Aggregate Maintenance

**Goal:** Implement algebraic incremental maintenance for decomposable aggregates
(COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, STDDEV), reducing per-group refresh from O(group_size)
to O(1) for the common case. This is the highest-potential-payoff item in the
performance plan — benchmarks show aggregate scenarios going from 2.5 ms to sub-1 ms
per group.

### Algebraic Aggregate Shortcuts (B-1)

> **In plain terms:** When only one row changes in a group of 100,000, today
> pg_trickle re-scans all 100,000 rows to recompute the aggregate. Algebraic
> maintenance keeps running totals: `new_sum = old_sum + Δsum`, `new_count =
> old_count + Δcount`. Only MIN/MAX needs a rescan — and only when the deleted
> value *was* the current minimum or maximum.

| Item | Description | Effort | Ref |
|------|-------------|--------|-----|
| B1-1 | Algebraic rules: COUNT, SUM, AVG, STDDEV (Welford online algorithm), MIN/MAX with rescan guard when deleted value equals current extremum | 3–4 wk | [PLAN_NEW_STUFF.md §B-1](plans/performance/PLAN_NEW_STUFF.md) |
| B1-2 | Auxiliary column management (`__pgt_aux_count`, `__pgt_aux_sum`, etc.); view wrapper to hide from user queries | 1–2 wk | [PLAN_NEW_STUFF.md §B-1](plans/performance/PLAN_NEW_STUFF.md) |
| B1-3 | Migration story for existing aggregate stream tables; periodic full-group recomputation to reset floating-point drift | 1 wk | [PLAN_NEW_STUFF.md §B-1](plans/performance/PLAN_NEW_STUFF.md) |
| B1-4 | Fallback to full-group recomputation for non-decomposable aggregates (`mode`, percentile, `string_agg` with ordering) | 1 wk | [PLAN_NEW_STUFF.md §B-1](plans/performance/PLAN_NEW_STUFF.md) |
| B1-5 | Property-based tests: MIN/MAX boundary case (deleting the exact current min or max value must trigger rescan) | 1 wk | [PLAN_NEW_STUFF.md §B-1](plans/performance/PLAN_NEW_STUFF.md) |

> ⚠️ Critical: the MIN/MAX maintenance rule is directionally tricky. The correct
> condition for triggering a rescan is: deleted value **equals** the current min/max
> (not when it differs). Getting this backwards silently produces stale aggregates
> on the most common OLTP delete pattern. See the corrected table and risk analysis
> in PLAN_NEW_STUFF.md §B-1.

> **Retraction consideration (B-1):** Keep in v0.10.0, but item B1-5 (property-based
> tests covering the MIN/MAX boundary case) is a **hard prerequisite** for B1-1, not
> optional follow-on work. The MIN/MAX rule was stated backwards in the original spec;
> the corrected rule is now in PLAN_NEW_STUFF.md. Do not merge any MIN/MAX algebraic
> path until property-based tests confirm: (a) deleting the exact current min triggers
> a rescan and (b) deleting a non-min value does not. Floating-point drift reset
> (B1-3) is also required before enabling persistent auxiliary columns.

> **Algebraic aggregates subtotal: ~7–9 weeks**

> **v0.10.0 total: ~7–9 weeks**

**Exit criteria:**
- [ ] COUNT/SUM/AVG/STDDEV algebraic paths implemented and benchmarked vs. full-group recompute
- [ ] MIN/MAX boundary case (delete-the-extremum) covered by property-based tests
- [ ] Auxiliary columns hidden from user queries via view wrapper
- [ ] Migration path for existing aggregate stream tables tested
- [ ] Floating-point drift reset mechanism in place (periodic recompute)
- [ ] Extension upgrade path tested (`0.9.0 → 0.10.0`)

## v0.11.0 — Partitioned Stream Tables & Operational Scale

**Goal:** Enable stream table storage to be declaratively partitioned (scope MERGE
to affected partitions for 100× I/O reduction on large tables), make the DAG
rebuild incremental for large multi-ST deployments, and add per-database worker
quotas for multi-tenant environments.

### Partitioned Stream Tables — Storage (A-1)

> **In plain terms:** A 10M-row stream table partitioned into 100 ranges means only
> the 2–3 partitions that actually received changes are touched by MERGE — reducing
> the MERGE scan from 10M rows to ~100K. The partition key must be a user-visible
> column and the refresh path must inject a verified range predicate.

| Item | Description | Effort | Ref |
|------|-------------|--------|-----|
| A1-1 | DDL: `CREATE STREAM TABLE … PARTITION BY` declaration; catalog column for partition key | 1–2 wk | [PLAN_NEW_STUFF.md §A-1](plans/performance/PLAN_NEW_STUFF.md) |
| A1-2 | Delta inspection: extract min/max of partition key from delta CTE per scheduler tick | 1 wk | [PLAN_NEW_STUFF.md §A-1](plans/performance/PLAN_NEW_STUFF.md) |
| A1-3 | MERGE rewrite: inject validated partition-key range predicate or issue per-partition MERGEs via Rust loop | 2–3 wk | [PLAN_NEW_STUFF.md §A-1](plans/performance/PLAN_NEW_STUFF.md) |
| A1-4 | E2E benchmarks: 10M-row partitioned ST, 0.1% change rate concentrated in 2–3 partitions | 1 wk | [PLAN_NEW_STUFF.md §A-1](plans/performance/PLAN_NEW_STUFF.md) |

> ⚠️ MERGE joins on `__pgt_row_id` (a content hash unrelated to the partition key) —
> partition pruning will **not** activate automatically. A predicate injection step
> is mandatory. See PLAN_NEW_STUFF.md §A-1 risk analysis before starting.

> **Retraction consideration (A-1):** The 5–7 week effort estimate is optimistic. The
> core assumption — that partition pruning can be activated via a `WHERE partition_key
> BETWEEN ? AND ?` predicate — requires the partition key to be a tracked catalog column
> (not currently the case) and a verified range derivation from the delta. The alternative
> (per-partition MERGE loop in Rust) is architecturally sound but requires significant
> catalog and refresh-path changes. A **design spike** (2–4 days) producing a written
> implementation plan must be completed before A1-1 is started. The milestone is at P3 /
> Very High risk and should not block the 1.0 release if the design spike reveals
> additional complexity.

> **Partitioned stream tables subtotal: ~5–7 weeks**

### Incremental DAG Rebuild (C-2)

| Item | Description | Effort | Ref |
|------|-------------|--------|-----|
| C2-1 | Replace single `pgt_id` scalar in shared memory with a bounded ring buffer of affected IDs; full-rebuild fallback on overflow | 1 wk | [PLAN_NEW_STUFF.md §C-2](plans/performance/PLAN_NEW_STUFF.md) |
| C2-2 | Incremental topo-sort on affected subgraph; cache sorted schedule in shared memory | 1–2 wk | [PLAN_NEW_STUFF.md §C-2](plans/performance/PLAN_NEW_STUFF.md) |

> ⚠️ A single `pgt_id` scalar in shared memory is vulnerable to overwrite when two DDL
> changes arrive between scheduler ticks — use a ring buffer or fall back to full rebuild.
> See PLAN_NEW_STUFF.md §C-2 risk analysis.

> **Incremental DAG rebuild subtotal: ~2–3 weeks**

### Multi-Database Scheduler Isolation (C-3)

| Item | Description | Effort | Ref |
|------|-------------|--------|-----|
| C3-1 | Per-database worker quotas (`pg_trickle.per_database_worker_quota`); priority ordering (IMMEDIATE > Hot > Warm > Cold); burst capacity up to 150% when other DBs are under budget | 2–3 wk | [PLAN_NEW_STUFF.md §C-3](plans/performance/PLAN_NEW_STUFF.md) |

> **Multi-DB isolation subtotal: ~2–3 weeks**

> **v0.11.0 total: ~9–13 weeks**

**Exit criteria:**
- [ ] Declaratively partitioned stream tables accepted; partition key tracked in catalog
- [ ] Partition-scoped MERGE benchmark: 10M-row ST, 0.1% change rate (expect ~100× I/O reduction)
- [ ] Ring-buffer DAG invalidation safe under rapid consecutive DDL changes (property-based test)
- [ ] Per-database worker quotas enforced; burst reclaimed within 1 scheduler cycle
- [ ] Extension upgrade path tested (`0.10.0 → 0.11.0`)

## v0.12.0 — Multi-Source Delta Batching & CDC Research

**Goal:** Implement multi-source delta merging for join queries where multiple
source tables change simultaneously, and conduct a formal research spike for
the custom logical decoding output plugin (D-2) before committing to a full
implementation.

### Multi-Table Delta Batching (B-3)

> **In plain terms:** When a join query has three source tables and all three
> change in the same cycle, today pg_trickle makes three separate passes through
> the source tables. B-3 merges those passes into one and prunes UNION ALL
> branches for sources with no changes.

| Item | Description | Effort | Ref |
|------|-------------|--------|-----|
| B3-1 | Intra-query delta-branch pruning: skip UNION ALL branch entirely when a source has zero changes in this cycle | 1–2 wk | [PLAN_NEW_STUFF.md §B-3](plans/performance/PLAN_NEW_STUFF.md) |
| B3-2 | Merged-delta generation: weight aggregation (`GROUP BY __pgt_row_id, SUM(weight)`) for cross-source deduplication; remove zero-weight rows | 3–4 wk | [PLAN_NEW_STUFF.md §B-3](plans/performance/PLAN_NEW_STUFF.md) |
| B3-3 | Property-based correctness tests for simultaneous multi-source changes; diamond-flow scenarios | 1–2 wk | [PLAN_NEW_STUFF.md §B-3](plans/performance/PLAN_NEW_STUFF.md) |

> ⚠️ Cross-delta deduplication **must use weight aggregation (`SUM(weight)` grouped by
> `__pgt_row_id`), not `DISTINCT ON`**. `DISTINCT ON` silently discards corrections
> that should be summed and will produce wrong data for diamond-flow queries — the
> exact scenario this feature targets. Do not merge B3-2 without passing property-based
> correctness proofs. See PLAN_NEW_STUFF.md §B-3 risk analysis.

> **Retraction candidate (B-3):** The spec contains a correctness bug at the design level
> — the originally proposed `DISTINCT ON` deduplication produces silently wrong results
> for diamond-flow delta paths. The corrected approach (Z-set weight aggregation) is
> conceptually sound but requires formal correctness proofs or exhaustive property-based
> tests before any code is written. The risk rating is **Very High**. Recommend moving
> B-3 out of the numbered roadmap into a **post-1.0 research backlog** unless a formal
> correctness proof for the weight-aggregation path exists prior to v0.12.0 scoping.

> **Multi-source delta batching subtotal: ~5–8 weeks**

### Async CDC — Research Spike (D-2)

> **In plain terms:** A custom PostgreSQL logical decoding plugin could write changes
> directly to change buffers without the polling round-trip, cutting CDC latency by
> ~10× and WAL decoding CPU by 50–80%. This milestone scopes a research spike only —
> not a full implementation — to validate the key technical constraints.

| Item | Description | Effort | Ref |
|------|-------------|--------|-----|
| D2-R | Research spike: prototype in-memory row buffering inside `pg_trickle_decoder`; validate SPI flush in `commit` callback; document memory-safety constraints and feasibility; produce a written RFC before any full implementation is started | 2–3 wk | [PLAN_NEW_STUFF.md §D-2](plans/performance/PLAN_NEW_STUFF.md) |

> ⚠️ SPI writes inside logical decoding `change` callbacks are **not supported**.
> All row buffering must occur in-memory within the plugin's memory context; flush
> only in the `commit` callback. In-memory buffers must handle arbitrarily large
> transactions. See PLAN_NEW_STUFF.md §D-2 risk analysis before writing any C code.

> **Retraction candidate (D-2):** Even as a research spike, this item introduces C-level
> complexity (custom output plugin memory management, commit-callback SPI failure
> handling, arbitrarily large transaction buffering) that substantially exceeds the
> stated 2–3 week estimate once the architectural constraints are respected. The risk
> rating is **Very High** and the SPI-in-change-callback infeasibility makes the
> originally proposed design non-functional. Recommend moving D-2 to a **post-1.0
> research backlog** entirely; do not include it in a numbered milestone until a
> separate feasibility study (outside the release cycle) produces a concrete RFC.

> **D-2 research spike subtotal: ~2–3 weeks**

### UNLOGGED Change Buffers — Opt-In (D-1)

| Item | Description | Effort | Ref |
|------|-------------|--------|-----|
| D-1 | UNLOGGED Change Buffers — create change buffers as `UNLOGGED` to reduce CDC WAL amplification; `pg_trickle.unlogged_buffers` GUC (default `false`, opt-in); crash recovery and standby promotion trigger FULL refresh | 1–2 wk | [PLAN_NEW_STUFF.md §D-1](plans/performance/PLAN_NEW_STUFF.md) |

> Moved from v0.5.0. Default flipped to `false` (opt-in only) to avoid forced FULL
> refreshes on all stream tables for users who have not explicitly accepted the
> crash/standby tradeoff.

> **D-1 subtotal: ~1–2 weeks**

> **v0.12.0 total: ~8–13 weeks**

**Exit criteria:**
- [ ] Intra-query delta-branch pruning: zero-change sources produce no UNION ALL branch
- [ ] Merged-delta path passes property-based correctness tests for simultaneous multi-source changes
- [ ] D-2 spike: prototype exists; SPI-in-commit-callback constraint validated; RFC written
- [ ] D-1: UNLOGGED change buffers opt-in (`unlogged_buffers = false` by default); crash-recovery FULL-refresh path tested
- [ ] Extension upgrade path tested (`0.11.0 → 0.12.0`)

## v1.0.0 — Stable Release

**Goal:** First officially supported release. Semantic versioning locks in.
API, catalog schema, and GUC names are considered stable. Focus is
distribution — getting pg_trickle onto package registries.

### Release engineering

> **In plain terms:** The 1.0 release is the official "we stand behind this
> API" declaration — from this point on the function names, catalog schema,
> and configuration settings won't change without a major version bump. The
> practical work is getting pg_trickle onto standard package registries
> (PGXN, apt, rpm) so it can be installed with the same commands as any
> other PostgreSQL extension, and hardening the CloudNativePG integration
> for Kubernetes deployments.

> **v1.0.0 total: ~18–27 hours**

**Exit criteria:**
- [ ] Published on PGXN and Docker Hub
- [x] CNPG extension image published to GHCR (`pg_trickle-ext`)
- [x] CNPG cluster-example.yaml validated (Image Volume approach)
- [ ] Upgrade path from v0.12.0 tested
- [ ] Semantic versioning policy in effect

## Post-1.0 — Scale & Ecosystem

These are not gated on 1.0 but represent the longer-term horizon.

### Ecosystem expansion

> **In plain terms:** Building first-class integrations with the tools most
> data teams already use — a proper dbt adapter (beyond just a
> materialization macro), an Airflow provider so you can trigger stream
> table refreshes from Airflow DAGs, a `pgtrickle` command-line tool for
> managing stream tables without writing SQL, and integration guides for
> popular ORMs and migration frameworks like Django, SQLAlchemy, Flyway, and
> Liquibase.

| Item | Description | Effort | Ref |

| E1 | dbt full adapter (`dbt-pgtrickle` extending `dbt-postgres`) | 20–30h | [PLAN_DBT_ADAPTER.md](plans/dbt/PLAN_DBT_ADAPTER.md) |
| E2 | Airflow provider (`apache-airflow-providers-pgtrickle`) | 16–20h | [PLAN_ECO_SYSTEM.md §4](plans/ecosystem/PLAN_ECO_SYSTEM.md) |
| E3 | CLI tool (`pgtrickle`) for management outside SQL | 16–20h | [PLAN_ECO_SYSTEM.md §4](plans/ecosystem/PLAN_ECO_SYSTEM.md) |
| E4 | Flyway / Liquibase migration support | 8–12h | [PLAN_ECO_SYSTEM.md §5](plans/ecosystem/PLAN_ECO_SYSTEM.md) |
| E5 | ORM integrations guide (SQLAlchemy, Django, etc.) | 8–12h | [PLAN_ECO_SYSTEM.md §5](plans/ecosystem/PLAN_ECO_SYSTEM.md) |

### Scale

> **In plain terms:** When you have hundreds of stream tables or a very
> large cluster, the single background worker that drives pg_trickle today
> can become a bottleneck. These items explore running the scheduler as an
> external sidecar process (outside the database itself), distributing
> stream tables across Citus shards for horizontal scale-out, and managing
> stream tables that span multiple databases in the same PostgreSQL cluster.

| Item | Description | Effort | Ref |
|------|-------------|--------|-----|
| S1 | External orchestrator sidecar for 100+ STs | 20–40h | [REPORT_PARALLELIZATION.md](plans/performance/REPORT_PARALLELIZATION.md) §D |
| S2 | Citus / distributed PostgreSQL compatibility | ~6 months | [plans/infra/CITUS.md](plans/infra/CITUS.md) |
| S3 | Multi-database support (beyond `postgres` DB) | TBD | [PLAN_MULTI_DATABASE.md](plans/infra/PLAN_MULTI_DATABASE.md) |

### Advanced SQL

> **In plain terms:** A collection of longer-horizon features that each
> require significant research and implementation — full circular dependency
> execution, the remaining pieces of true in-transaction IVM (C-level
> triggers, transition table sharing), backward-compatibility all the way to
> PG 14/15, forward-compatibility with PostgreSQL 19, partitioned stream
> table storage, and several query-planner improvements that reduce the cost
> of computing incremental updates for wide tables and functions with many
> columns.
